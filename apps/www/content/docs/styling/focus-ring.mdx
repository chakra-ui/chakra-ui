title: Focus Ring
description: Styling focus states in Chakra UI
---

The focus ring is used to identify the currently focused element on your page.
This is important for accessibility, however, styling every component to have a
focus ring can be tedious.

Chakra UI provides the `focusRing` and `focusVisibleRing` style props to style
focus ring with ease. The value of the `focusRing` prop can be "outside",
"inside", or "mixed".

## Focus Ring

This focus ring maps to the `&:is(:focus, [data-focus])` CSS selector.

Let's say we want to style a button from scratch with a focus ring.

```tsx
<chakra.button px="4" py="2" focusRing="outside">
  Click me
</chakra.button>
```

## Focus Visible Ring

This focus ring maps to the `&:is(:focus-visible, [data-focus-visible])` CSS
selector.

```tsx
<chakra.button px="4" py="2" focusVisibleRing="outside">
  Click me
</chakra.button>
```

## Customization

### Ring Color

To change the focus ring color for a specific component, you can use the
`focusRingColor` prop.

```tsx
<Button focusRingColor="red.500">Click me</Button>
```

To change the color of the focus ring globally, you can configure the
`focusRing` semantic token.

```tsx {2-4}
const colors = defineSemanticTokens.colors({
  focusRing: {
    value: { base: "{colors.red.500}", _dark: "{colors.red.500}" },
  },
})
```

### Ring Width

To change the focus ring width for a specific component, you can use the
`focusRingWidth` prop.

```tsx
<Button focusRingWidth="2px">Click me</Button>
```
