## Overview

Responsive design is a fundamental aspect of modern web development, allowing
websites and applications to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and
devices.

:::info

Chakra uses a mobile-first breakpoint system and leverages min-width media
queries `@media(min-width)` when you write responsive styles.

:::

Chakra provides five breakpoints by default:

```ts
const breakpoints = {
  base: "0em", // 0px
  sm: "30em", // ~480px
  md: "48em", // ~768px
  lg: "62em", // ~992px
  xl: "80em", // ~1280px
  "2xl": "96em", // ~1536px
}
```

## Object syntax

Here's an example of how to change the font weight of a text on large screens

```jsx
<Text fontWeight="medium" lg={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>
  Text
</Text>
```

or use the prop based modifier

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={{ base: "medium", lg: "bold" }}>Text</Text>
```

## Array syntax

Chakra also accepts arrays as values for responsive styles. Pass the
corresponding value for each breakpoint in the array. Using our previous code as
an example:

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={["medium", undefined, undefined, "bold"]}>Text</Text>
```

Notice the use of `undefined` for the breakpoints to skip the `md` and `lg`
breakpoints.

## Breakpoint targeting

### Breakpoint range

Chakra provides a way to target a range of breakpoints using the `To` notation.
To apply styles between the `md` and `xl` breakpoints, use the `mdToXl`
property:

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={{ mdToXl: "bold" }}>Text</Text>
```

> This text will only be bold from `md` to `xl` breakpoints.

### Only breakpoint

To target a single breakpoint, use the `Only` notation. Here's an example of how
to apply styles only in the `lg` breakpoint, using the `lgOnly` property:

```jsx
<Text fontWeight={{ lgOnly: "bold" }}>Text</Text>
```

## Hiding elements at breakpoint

Chakra provides the `hideFrom` and `hideBelow` utilities to hide elements at
specific breakpoints.

To hide an element from the `md` breakpoint, use the `hideFrom` utility:

```jsx
<Stack hideFrom="md">
  <Text>This text will be hidden from the `md` breakpoint</Text>
</Stack>
```

To hide an element below the `md` breakpoint, use the `hideBelow` utility:

```jsx
<Stack hideBelow="md">
  <Text>This text will be hidden below the `md` breakpoint</Text>
</Stack>
```
