## Installation

To manually set up Chakra UI in your project, follow the steps below.

:::steps

### Install `@chakra-ui/react`

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react
```

### Setup provider

Wrap your application with the `ChakraProvider` at the root of your application.

```jsx
import { ChakraProvider, defaultSystem } from "@chakra-ui/react"

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider system={defaultSystem}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

### Update tsconfig

If you're using TypeScript, you need to update the `compilerOptions` in the
tsconfig file to include the following options:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  }
}
```

### Add compositions (optional)

Compositions are pre-built components that you can use to build your UI faster.
Using the `@chakra-ui/cli` you can add compositions to your project.

```bash
# Install CLI
npm i -D @chakra-ui/cli

# Add compositions
chakra add compositions
```
