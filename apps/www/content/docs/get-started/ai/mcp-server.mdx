description:
  The Chakra UI MCP server bridges the gap between AI tools and Chakra UI app
  development.
---

Model-Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication standard designed to help LLMs
(Large Language Models) understand and interact with software systems in a
structured, context-aware manner.

The Chakra UI MCP Server is a specialized Model Context Protocol server that
provides AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, and others) .

## Features

- Component library access to get components, props, and usage examples
- Migration support for upgrading from Chakra UI v2 to v3
- Design tokens access to semantic tokens and text styles for consistent theming
- Premium 200+ Templates via Chakra UI Pro blocks (requires API key)

## Set up

To run the MCP server in a local or development environment using Claude
Desktop, Cursor, or any compatible MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CHAKRA_PRO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The `CHAKRA_PRO_API_KEY` is optional. 💡 Replace "your-api-key-here" with a
> valid Chakra Pro key to unlock premium templates and blocks.

## Connecting to MCP Client

The Chakra UI MCP Server is designed to work with any tool that supports the
Model Context Protocol (MCP). Below are instructions to connect your local
Chakra UI MCP server with popular clients.

### Claude Code (Anthropic)

Ensure you have Claude Code installed. Visit
[Anthropic docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for
installation instructions.

1. Add the Chakra UI MCP server In your terminal, run:

```bash
claude mcp add chakra-ui -- npx -y @chakra-ui/mcp
```

2. Start a Claude Code session by running `claude`.

Now, you can start using the Chakra MCP server.

### VS Code (with GitHub Copilot)

> To use MCP servers with VS Code, you need to have
> [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
> and
> [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
> extensions installed

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json`file at the root of your project.

2. Within that file, add the MCP server block:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click on Start on the MCP server.

### Cursor

1. Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` at the root of your project.

2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> If Cursor doesn’t automatically detect the changes, restart the editor or
> manually enable the Chakra UI server via "MCP Tools."

### Windsurf

1. Navigate to the Cascade Assistant sidebar.

2. Click on the hammer icon, then click the "Configure" button. This opens up
   the "Manage MCPs" file in Windsurf.

3. Select "View raw config" to open the Windsurf's MCP configuration file.

4. Inside the raw configuration file, add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Chakra UI": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the MCP configuration file.

### Zed

1. Open Zed Preview application.

2. Go to Assistant > Settings.

3. Within the Context Servers section, click "+ Add Context Server" to add the
   Chakra UI MCP Server

- Name: Chakra UI
- Comman:

```bash
npx -y @chakra-ui/mcp
```

4. Select Add Server and confirm that “Chakra UI” appears under Context Servers.
