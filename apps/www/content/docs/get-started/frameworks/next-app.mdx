## Templates

Use one of the following templates to get started quickly. The templates are
configured correctly to use Chakra UI.

:::card-group

<ResourceCard
  type="github"
  title="Next.js app template"
  url="https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/sandbox/next-app"
/>

<ResourceCard
  type="github"
  title="Next.js pages template"
  url="https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/sandbox/next-pages"
/>

## Installation

> The minimum node version required is Node.20.x

:::steps

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react
```

### Add snippets

Snippets are pre-built components that you can use to build your UI faster.
Using the `@chakra-ui/cli` you can add snippets to your project.

```bash
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add
```

### Update tsconfig

If you're using TypeScript, you need to update the `compilerOptions` in the
tsconfig file to include the following options:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

> If you're using JavaScript, create a `jsconfig.json` file and add the above
> code to the file.

### Setup provider

Wrap your application with the `Provider` component generated in the
`components/ui/provider` component at the root of your application.

This provider composes the following:

- `ChakraProvider` from `@chakra-ui/react` for the styling system
- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` for color mode

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx" {1,6,8}
import { Provider } from "@/components/ui/provider"

export default function RootLayout(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { children } = props
  return (
    <html suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body>
        <Provider>{children}</Provider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

> Adding the `suppressHydrationWarning` prop to the `html` element is required
> to prevent the warning about the `next-themes` library.

### Optimize Bundle

We recommend using the `experimental.optimizePackageImports` feature in Next.js
to optimize your bundle size by loading only the modules that you are actually
using.

```tsx title="next.config.mjs" {3}
export default {
  experimental: {
    optimizePackageImports: ["@chakra-ui/react"],
  },
}
```

This also helps to resolve warnings like:

```sh
[webpack.cache.PackFileCacheStrategy] Serializing big strings (xxxkiB)
```

### Hydration errors

If you see an error like this: **Hydration failed because the initial server
rendered HTML did not match the client**, and the error looks similar to:

```diff
+<div className="chakra-xxx">
-<style data-emotion="css-global xxx" data-s="">
```

This is caused by how Next.js hydrates Emotion CSS in `--turbo` mode. Please
remove the `--turbo` flag from your `dev` script in your `package.json` file.

```diff
- "dev": "next dev --turbo"
+ "dev": "next dev"
```

When this is fixed by the `Next.js` team, we'll update this guide.

### Enjoy!

With the power of the snippets and the primitive components from Chakra UI, you
can build your UI faster.

```tsx
import { Button, HStack } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <HStack>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </HStack>
  )
}
```
