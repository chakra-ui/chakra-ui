---

The Chakra UI CLI can be used to generate typings for your custom theme tokens,
like colors, semantic tokens, recipe variants, etc. You can also add community
snippets and premium Pro blocks to your project.

## Installation

In order to use the CLI, you need to install it as a dev dependency in your
project:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i -D @chakra-ui/cli
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @chakra-ui/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun add -d @chakra-ui/cli
```

:::

:::warning

To use the CLI tool, please ensure that the version of Node.js is `>= 20.6.0`.

:::

## Usage

Use the Chakra CLI to run any of the commands listed below with your preferred
package manager.

```bash
Usage: npx chakra [options] [command]

The official CLI for Chakra UI projects

Options:
  -V, --version               output the version number
  -h, --help                  display help for command

Commands:
  typegen [options] <source>  Generate theme and recipe typings
  snippet                     Add snippets to your project for better DX
  blocks                      Add Chakra UI Pro blocks to your project
  eject [options]             Take control over the default theme tokens and recipes
  help [command]              display help for command
```

## `chakra typegen`

Generates theme and recipe typings for your custom theme. This helps to provide
autocompletion and type safety in your project.

```bash
# Generate typings
chakra typegen src/theme.ts

# Watch for changes and rebuild
chakra typegen src/theme.ts --watch

# Generate strict types for props variant and size
chakra typegen src/theme.ts --strict
```

### When to run typegen

The `typegen` command works in both **development** and **CI/CD**. It is not
limited to local use—run it everywhere your project is built or installed so
generated types stay up to date.

### Workflow integration

Add `typegen` to the `postinstall` or `prepare` script of the frontend
application that uses Chakra UI. This ensures types are generated:

- After `npm install` / `pnpm install` / `bun install` (local development)
- During CI/CD when dependencies are installed before build
- In production builds when running `npm ci` or similar

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "chakra typegen src/theme.ts",
    "prepare": "chakra typegen src/theme.ts"
  }
}
```

:::tip

Use `postinstall` if you want types generated after every install. Use `prepare`
if you also need it to run when the package is packed (e.g. for publishing). Use
one or the other to avoid running typegen twice.

:::

### Monorepo setup

In a monorepo (e.g. pnpm workspaces), run `typegen` **in the package that
depends on Chakra UI**—typically your frontend application—not at the monorepo
root.

1. Install `@chakra-ui/cli` as a dev dependency in the frontend package.
2. Add the `postinstall` or `prepare` script to that package's `package.json`.

```json
// packages/frontend/package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "chakra typegen src/theme.ts"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@chakra-ui/react": "..."
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@chakra-ui/cli": "..."
  }
}
```

When you run `pnpm install` at the root, the frontend package's `postinstall`
runs and generates types in the correct package.

## `chakra snippet`

Generates useful component compositions that boost your development speed.

```bash
# Add all snippets
chakra snippet add --all

# Add a specific snippet
chakra snippet add button

# List all available snippets
chakra snippet list

# Specify a custom directory
chakra snippet add dialog --outdir ./components/custom
```

## `chakra blocks`

Add premium blocks from Chakra UI Pro to your project. These are professionally
designed, fully responsive components that you can customize for your needs.

```bash
# Interactive block selection
chakra blocks add

# Add all variants of a specific block
chakra blocks add hero

# Add a specific variant of a block
chakra blocks add hero --variant "simple"

# List available blocks
chakra blocks list

# List blocks in a specific category
chakra blocks list --category "marketing"

# Preview blocks without downloading
chakra blocks add --dry-run --category "marketing"

# Specify output directory
chakra blocks add --outdir ./components/blocks
```

### Pro API Key Setup

To use Pro blocks, you need a Chakra UI Pro subscription and API key:

1. Get your API key from [Chakra UI Pro](https://pro.chakra-ui.com)
2. Set the environment variable:

   ```bash
   export CHAKRA_UI_PRO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file in your project root:

   ```env
   CHAKRA_UI_PRO_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Add it to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence if
   using environment variables

### Available Options

- `--variant <variant>`: Add a specific variant instead of all variants
- `--outdir <dir>`: Specify output directory for blocks
- `--force`: Overwrite existing files
- `--dry-run`: Preview what will be downloaded without writing files
- `--tsx`: Force TypeScript JSX format (auto-detected by default)

## `chakra eject`

Generates the file(s) that contain the default theme tokens and recipes so you
can have full control over them.

```bash
# Copy the tokens and recipes to your project
chakra eject --outdir src/theme
```

## FAQ

### Is typegen only for local development?

No. The `typegen` command works in both development and CI/CD. Add it to
`postinstall` or `prepare` so it runs after installs—locally and in your CI
pipeline.

### Autocomplete for custom tokens not working?

After generating the typings, you need to "Restart TS Server" for the
autocomplete to show up.

Alternatively, you can install the `@chakra-ui/cli` package locally as a dev
dependency and run the `chakra typegen` command to generate the typings.
