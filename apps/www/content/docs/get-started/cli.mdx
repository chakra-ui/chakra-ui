chakra typegen src/theme.ts --watch

# Generate strict types for props variant and size
chakra typegen src/theme.ts --strict
```

## `chakra snippet`

Generates useful component compositions that boost your development speed.

```bash
# Add all snippets
chakra snippet add

# Add a specific snippet
chakra snippet add button

# List all available snippets
chakra snippet list

# Specify a custom directory
chakra snippet --dir ./components/custom
```

## `chakra eject`

Generated the file(s) that contain the default theme tokens and recipes so you
can have full control over them.

```bash
# Copy the tokens and recipes to your project
chakra eject --outdir src/theme
```

## FAQ

### Autocomplete for custom tokens not working?

After generating the typings, you need to "Restart TS Server" for the
autocomplete to show up.

Alternatively, you can install the `@chakra-ui/cli` package locally as a dev
dependency and run the `chakra typegen` command to generate the typings.
