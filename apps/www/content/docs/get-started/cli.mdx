## `chakra typegen`

Generates theme and recipe typings for your custom theme. This helps to provide
autocompletion and type safety in your project.

```bash
# Generate typings
chakra typegen src/theme.ts

# Watch for changes and rebuild
chakra typegen src/theme.ts --watch

# Generate strict types for props variant and size
chakra typegen src/theme.ts --strict
```

## `chakra snippet`

Generates useful component compositions that boost your development speed.

```bash
# Add all snippets
chakra snippet add --all

# Add a specific snippet
chakra snippet add button

# List all available snippets
chakra snippet list

# Specify a custom directory
chakra snippet add dialog --outdir ./components/custom
```

## `chakra blocks`

Add premium blocks from Chakra UI Pro to your project. These are professionally
designed, fully responsive components that you can customize for your needs.

```bash
# Interactive block selection
chakra blocks add

# Add all variants of a specific block
chakra blocks add hero

# Add a specific variant of a block
chakra blocks add hero --variant "simple"

# List available blocks
chakra blocks list

# List blocks in a specific category
chakra blocks list --category "marketing"

# Preview blocks without downloading
chakra blocks add --dry-run --category "marketing"

# Specify output directory
chakra blocks add --outdir ./components/blocks
```

### Pro API Key Setup

To use Pro blocks, you need a Chakra UI Pro subscription and API key:

1. Get your API key from [Chakra UI Pro](https://pro.chakra-ui.com)
2. Set the environment variable:

   ```bash
   export CHAKRA_UI_PRO_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file in your project root:

   ```env
   CHAKRA_UI_PRO_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Add it to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) for persistence if
   using environment variables

### Available Options

- `--variant <variant>`: Add a specific variant instead of all variants
- `--outdir <dir>`: Specify output directory for blocks
- `--force`: Overwrite existing files
- `--dry-run`: Preview what will be downloaded without writing files
- `--tsx`: Force TypeScript JSX format (auto-detected by default)

## `chakra eject`

Generated the file(s) that contain the default theme tokens and recipes so you
can have full control over them.

```bash
# Copy the tokens and recipes to your project
chakra eject --outdir src/theme
```

## FAQ

### Autocomplete for custom tokens not working?

After generating the typings, you need to "Restart TS Server" for the
autocomplete to show up.

Alternatively, you can install the `@chakra-ui/cli` package locally as a dev
dependency and run the `chakra typegen` command to generate the typings.
