## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`toaster` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add toaster
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Toast` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Toaster, toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster"
```

First, render the `Toaster` component in your app.

```jsx
<Toaster />
```

Then, create a toast by calling the `toaster` function.

```jsx
toaster.create({
  title: "Toast Title",
  description: "Toast Description",
})
```

## Examples

### Persistent Toast

Set the `type` prop to `"loading"` to create a persistent toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-persistent" />

### Types

Here's an example of each type of toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-status" />

### With Action

Use the `action` and `actionLabel` prop to add an action to the toast.

> When the action trigger is clicked, the toast will be closed.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-action" />

### Promise

Use the `toaster.promise` to create a toast that resolves when the promise is
resolved.

Next, you can define the toast options (title, description, etc.) for each state
of the promise.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-promise" />

### Custom Duration

Use the `duration` prop to set the duration of the toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-duration" />

### Pause and Play

Use the `pause` and `resume` methods on the `toaster` object to pause and play
the toast.

Pausing a toast prevents it from timing out, while resuming it will reenable the
timeout using the remaining duration.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-pause-and-play" />

### Lifecycle

Use the `onStatusChange` prop on the `toaster` function to listen for changes to
the toast's status.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-lifecycle" />

### Maximum Visible Toasts

Set the `max` prop on the `createToaster` function to define the maximum number
of toasts that can be rendered at any one time. Any extra toasts will be queued
and rendered when a toast has been dismissed.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  max: 3,
})
```

### Placement

Toasts can be displayed on all four corners of a page. We recommend picking one
desired position and configure it in the `createToaster` function.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
})
```

### Overlapping Toasts

By default, toasts are stacked on top of each other. To make the toasts overlap
each other, set the `overlap` prop to `true` in the `createToaster` function.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
  overlap: true,
})
```

### Offset

Set the `offset` prop in the `createToaster` function to offset the toasts from
the edges of the screen.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: "20px",
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the `offset` prop to set the offset for each edge of
the screen.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: { left: "20px", top: "20px", right: "20px", bottom: "20px" },
})
```
