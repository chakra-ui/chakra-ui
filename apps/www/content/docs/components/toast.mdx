## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`toaster` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add toaster
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Toast` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Toaster, toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster"
```

First, render the `Toaster` component in your app.

```jsx
<Toaster />
```

Then, create a toast by calling the `toaster` function.

```jsx
toaster.create({
  title: "Toast Title",
  description: "Toast Description",
})
```

## Examples

### Closable Toast

Set the `closable` prop to `true` to create a closable toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-closable" />

### External Close

Use the `toaster.dismiss` method to close a toast.

- `toaster.dismiss(id)`: Dismiss a toast by its id.
- `toaster.dismiss()`: Dismiss all toasts.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-external-close" />

### Types

Here's an example of each type of toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-status" />

### With Action

Use the `action` and `actionLabel` prop to add an action to the toast.

> When the action trigger is clicked, the toast will be closed.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-action" />

### Persistent Toast

Set the `type` prop to `"loading"` to create a persistent toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-persistent" />

### Promise

Use the `toaster.promise` to create a toast that resolves when the promise is
resolved.

Next, you can define the toast options (title, description, etc.) for each state
of the promise.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-promise" />

### Update

Use `toaster.update(...)` to modify a visible toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-update" />

### Custom Duration

Use the `duration` prop to set the duration of the toast.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-with-duration" />

### Pause and Play

Use the `pause` and `resume` methods on the `toaster` object to pause and play
the toast.

Pausing a toast prevents it from timing out, while resuming it will reenable the
timeout using the remaining duration.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-pause-and-play" />

### Lifecycle

Use the `onStatusChange` prop on the `toaster` function to listen for changes to
the toast's status.

<ExampleTabs name="toaster-lifecycle" />

### Maximum Visible Toasts

Set the `max` prop on the `createToaster` function to define the maximum number
of toasts that can be rendered at any one time. Any extra toasts will be queued
and rendered when a toast has been dismissed.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  max: 3,
})
```

### Placement

Toasts can be displayed on all four corners of a page. We recommend picking one
desired position and configure it in the `createToaster` function.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
})
```

### Overlapping Toasts

By default, toasts are stacked on top of each other. To make the toasts overlap
each other, set the `overlap` prop to `true` in the `createToaster` function.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  placement: "top-end",
  overlap: true,
})
```

### Page Idle Behavior

Pause toast timers when the page is idle/hidden.

```tsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  pauseOnPageIdle: true,
})
```

### Offset

Set the `offsets` prop in the `createToaster` function to offset the toasts from
the edges of the screen.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: "20px",
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the `offsets` prop to set the offset for each edge of
the screen.

```jsx title="@/components/ui/toaster.tsx"
const toaster = createToaster({
  offsets: { left: "20px", top: "20px", right: "20px", bottom: "20px" },
})
```

## Accessibility

The Toast component follows accessibility best practices for notifications:

### Keyboard Support

- `Tab` - Moves focus between interactive elements within the toast (action
  buttons, close button)
- `Shift + Tab` - Moves focus backward through interactive elements
- `Enter` or `Space` - Activates the focused button
- `Esc` - Closes the toast (when the close trigger is present)

### Screen Reader Support

- Toasts use `role="status"` by default for non-critical notifications
  (automatically announced)
- For error or critical messages, toasts use `role="alert"` for immediate
  announcement
- The toast content is automatically announced to screen readers when it appears
- Toasts with actions remain visible until dismissed, allowing sufficient time
  for interaction

### Focus Management

- Toast notifications do not steal focus by default, allowing users to continue
  their current task
- When a toast contains interactive elements (action buttons), users can tab to
  them
- Focus is not trapped within the toast, maintaining natural page flow

### Best Practices

- Keep toast messages concise and actionable
- Provide sufficient time for users to read and act on toast messages (default:
  5 seconds)
- For critical information requiring action, use `type="error"` or increase the
  `duration`
- Ensure action button labels are descriptive and clear
