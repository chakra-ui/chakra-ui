## Usage

```jsx
import { Tour, useTour } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

## Shortcuts

TourActionTriggers renders all action buttons for the current step from its
`actions` array. Each action can be a built-in string
(`"next" | "prev" | "dismiss"`) or a custom handler.

This works (manual mapping):

```jsx
<Tour.Context>
  {(api) =>
    api.step?.actions?.map((action) => (
      <Tour.ActionTrigger key={action.label} action={action}>
        {action.label}
      </Tour.ActionTrigger>
    ))
  }
</Tour.Context>
```

This is more concise:

```jsx
<Tour.ActionTriggers />
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Control the tour programmatically with the `useTour` store (start, next, prev,
setStep, progress).

<ExampleTabs name="tour-controlled" />

### Sizes

The tour content doesn’t have a dedicated `size` prop. Instead, it automatically
adapts to the size of its container or the target element it’s attached to.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-sizes" />

### Placement

Control where the tooltip appears relative to its target using the `placement`
option per step.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-placements" />

### Without Arrow

Hide the arrow by setting `arrow: false` on a step.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-without-arrow" />

### Without Backdrop

Disable the dimmed background by setting `backdrop: false` on a step.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-without-backdrop" />

### Wait Step

Pause the tour until a condition is met (e.g., wait for a user click) using a
`type: "wait"` step.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-wait-step" />

### Immediate

Sync state changes immediately without deferring to the next frame.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-immediate" />

### Keyboard Navigation

Enable keyboard navigation to allow users to navigate between steps using arrow
keys (Left and Right). Pass `keyboardNavigation: true` to the `useTour` hook.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-keyboard" />

### Close on Escape

Close the tour when the user presses the Escape key. Pass `closeOnEscape: true`
to the `useTour` hook.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-close-on-escape" />

### Close on Interact Outside

Close the tour when the user clicks or interacts outside the tour content. Pass
`closeOnInteractOutside: true` to the `useTour` hook.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-close-on-interact-outside" />

### Prevent Interaction

Prevent interaction with the rest of the page while the tour is active. Pass
`preventInteraction: true` to the `useTour` hook.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-prevent-interaction" />

### Spotlight Offset

Customize the spacing around the spotlight by setting the `spotlightOffset`
property on each step. Pass an object with `x` and `y` values to adjust the
padding.

<ExampleTabs name="tour-with-spotlight-offset" />

### Root

<PropTable component="Tour" part="Root" />
