<ExampleTabs name="alert-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`alert` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add alert
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Alert` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Alert } from "@/components/ui/alert"
```

```jsx
<Alert title="Alert Title" icon={<LuTerminal />}>
  This is the alert description
</Alert>
```

## Examples

### Description

Use the `description` prop to provide additional context to the alert. This will
be displayed below the alert message.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-description" />

### Status

Change the status of the alerts by passing the `status` prop. This affects the
color scheme and icon used. Alert supports `error`, `success`, `warning`, and
`info` statuses.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-status" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the alert. Values can be
either `subtle`, `solid`, `outline`

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-variants" />

### Custom Icon

Use the `icon` prop to pass a custom icon to the alert. This will override the
default icon for the alert status.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-custom-icon" />

## Props

### Alert Root

These props can be passed to the `Alert` or `Alert.Root` component.

<PropTable component="Alert" part="AlertRoot" />
