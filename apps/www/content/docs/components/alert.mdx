## Examples

### Description

Render the `Alert.Description` component to provide additional context to the
alert.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-description" />

### Status

Change the status of the alerts by passing the `status` prop. This affects the
color scheme and icon used. Alert supports `error`, `success`, `warning`, and
`info` statuses.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-status" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the alert. Values can be
either `subtle`, `solid`, `outline`

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-variants" />

### Custom Icon

default icon for the alert status.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-custom-icon" />

### Color Palette Override

color palette, pass the `colorPalette` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="alert-with-color-palette-override" />

### Customization
