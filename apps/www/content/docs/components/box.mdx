## Usage

The `Box` component provides an easy way to write styles with ease. It provides
access to design tokens and an unmatched DX when writing responsive styles.

```jsx
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Box />
```

## Examples

### Shorthand

Use shorthand like `bg` instead of `backgroundColor`, `m` instead of `margin`,
etc.

<ExampleTabs name="box-with-shorthand" />

### Psuedo Props

Use pseudo props like `_hover` to apply styles on hover, `_focus` to apply
styles on focus, etc.

<ExampleTabs name="box-with-pseudo-props" />

### Border

Use the `borderWidth` and `borderColor` prop to apply border styles.

> **Good to know:** Chakra applies `borderStyle: solid` globally so you don't
> have to.

<ExampleTabs name="box-with-border" />

### As Prop

Use the `as` prop to render a different component.

> Inspect the DOM to see the rendered component.

<ExampleTabs name="box-with-as-prop" />

### Shadow

Use the `boxShadow` or `shadow` prop to apply shadow styles.

<ExampleTabs name="box-with-shadow" />

### Composition

Here's an example of a property card built with layout primitives in Chakra.

<ExampleTabs name="box-property-card" />

## Props

The `Box` component supports all CSS properties as props, making it easy to
style elements.
