<ExampleTabs name="action-bar-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`action-bar` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add action-bar
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition based on the `Popover`
component.

## Usage

The action bar is designed to be controlled by table or checkbox selections. It
provides a set of actions that can be performed on the selected items.

```jsx
import {
  ActionBarCloseTrigger,
  ActionBarContent,
  ActionBarRoot,
  ActionBarSelectionTrigger,
  ActionBarSeparator,
} from "@/components/ui/action-bar"
```

```jsx
<ActionBarRoot>
  <ActionBarContent>
    <ActionBarCloseTrigger />
    <ActionBarSelectionTrigger />
    <ActionBarSeparator />
    <Button />
  </ActionBarContent>
</ActionBarRoot>
```

## Examples

### Close Trigger

Render the `ActionBarCloseTrigger` to close the action bar, and pass the
`onOpenChange` handler to control the visibility of the action bar.

> The `open` and `onOpenChange` props control the visibility of the action bar.

<ExampleTabs name="action-bar-with-close-trigger" />

### Within Dialog

Here's an example of composing the `ActionBar` and the `Dialog` to perform a
delete action on a set of selected items.

> Press the `Delete projects` button to open the dialog.
