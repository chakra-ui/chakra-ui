## Usage

```jsx
import { Center, Circle, Square } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Center bg="tomato" h="100px" color="white">
  This is the Center
</Center>
```

## Examples

### Icon

Center can be used to create frames around icons or numbers.

<ExampleTabs name="center-with-icons" />

### Center with Inline

Use the `inline` prop to make `Center` behave like an inline element
(`display: inline-flex`) instead of a block-level element (`display: flex`).
This makes `Center` only take up as much width as its content needs, allowing it
to fit inside links, buttons, or other inline contexts without breaking the
layout.

<ExampleTabs name="center-with-inline" />

### Square

`Square` centers its child within a fixed-size container of equal width and
height. It accepts a `size` prop that sets both width and height to the same
value.

<ExampleTabs name="center-with-square" />

### Circle

`Circle` extends `Square` by adding `borderRadius="9999px"` to create a perfect
circle. Like `Square`, it accepts a `size` prop that sets both width and height
to the same value.

<ExampleTabs name="center-with-circle" />

## Props

### Center

<PropTable component="Center" part="Center" />

### Square

<PropTable component="Square" part="Square" />

### Circle

`Circle` extends `Square` and accepts all the same props. The only difference is
that `Circle` applies `borderRadius="9999px"`.

<PropTable component="Circle" part="Circle" />
