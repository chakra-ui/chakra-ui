<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`pin-input` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add pin-input
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `PinInput`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import { PinInput } from "@/components/ui/pin-input"
```

```jsx
<PinInput />
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the pin input component.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-sizes" />

### One time code

Use the `otp` prop to make the pin input component behave like a one-time code
input. This helps improve the user experience when entering OTP codes.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-otp" />

### Mask

Use the `mask` prop to obscure the entered pin code.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-mask" />

### Placeholder

Use the `placeholder` prop to add a placeholder to the pin input component.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-placeholder" />

### Field

Here's an example of how to compose the `Field` and the `PinInput` components

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-field" />

### Hook Form

Here's an example of how to compose the `Field` and the `PinInput` components
with `react-hook-form`

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-hook-form" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the pin input

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the pin input is to use the `RootProvider`
component and the `usePinInput` store hook.

This way you can access the pin input state and methods from outside the
component.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-with-store" />

### Attached

Use the `attached` prop to attach the pin input to the input field

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-attached" />

### Alphanumeric

Use the `type` prop to allow the user to enter alphanumeric characters. Values
can be either `alphanumeric`, `numeric`, or `alphabetic`

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-alphanumeric" />

### Without Snippet

If you don't want to use the snippet, you can use the `PinInput` component from
the `@chakra-ui/react` package.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-without-snippet" />

### Count

To increase the number of input fields, you can use the `count` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="pin-input-count" />

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="PinInput" part="Root" />
