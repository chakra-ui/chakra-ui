## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`blockquote` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add blockquote
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Blockquote`
component.

```jsx
import { Blockquote } from "@/components/ui/blockquote"
```

```jsx
<Blockquote dash cite="Uzumaki Naruto" citeUrl="#" />
```

## Examples

### With Cite

Use the `cite` prop to provide the source of the blockquote. This will be
displayed below the blockquote.

<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-with-cite" />

### Colors

Use the `colorPalette` prop to change the color of the blockquote.

<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-with-colors" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the blockquote. Values can
be either `subtle`, `solid`, `plain`.

<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-with-variants" />

### Icon

Use the `showIcon` prop to show an icon on the blockquote. The default icon is a
double quote.

<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-with-icon" />

### Justify

Use the `justify` prop to change the alignment of the blockquote. Values can be
either `start`, `center`, `end`.

<ExampleTabs name="blockquote-with-justify" />

### Custom Icon

Use the `icon` prop to change the icon of the blockquote.

### With Avatar

Here's an example of how to use the `Blockquote` with an avatar and float
components to create a stunning testimonial component.

from the `@chakra-ui/react` package.
