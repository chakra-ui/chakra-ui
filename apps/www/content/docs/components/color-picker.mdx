## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-sizes" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the color picker. Values
can be either `outline` or `subtle`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-variants" />

### Input Only

Combine the `ColorPicker.ValueSwatch` and the `ColorPicker.EyeDropper` on the
`InputGroup` to render a color picker that contains only an input.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-input-only" />

### Swatch Only

Use the `ColorPicker.SwatchGroup` and `ColorPicker.SwatchTrigger` to render only
the color swatches.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-swatch-only" />

### Trigger Only

Compose the color picker to initially show only a trigger using the
`ColorPicker.ValueSwatch` and `ColorPicker.ValueText`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-trigger-only" />

### Trigger Inside Input

Compose the color picker to trigger in input using the `InputGroup` and
`ColorPickerInput`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-trigger-only" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the state of the color
picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the color picker is to use the `RootProvider`
component and the `useColorPicker` store hook.

This way you can access the color picker state and methods from outside the
color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-store" />

### Change End

Use the `onValueChangeEnd` to listen to when the user finishes selecting a
color, rather than while they are scrubbing or dragging through the color area.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-change-end" />

### Channel Slider

Combine the `ColorPickerChannelSliders` and the `format` prop to add the
different color channels to the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-channel-slider-only" />

### Hook Form

Here's an example of how to integrate the color picker with `react-hook-form`.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-hook-form" />

### Inline

Here's an example of how to display an inline version of the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-inline" />

### Disabled

Pass the `disabled` prop to disable the color picker.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-disabled" />

### Channel Input

Use the `ChannelFormat.Select` and `ColorPicker.ChannelInput` to create a color
picker that allows users to select their preferred channel.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-channel-input" />

### Fit Content

Pass the `data-fit-content` attribute to the `ColorPicker.Trigger` to make it
fit the content.

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-fit-content" />

### ReadOnly

Use the `readOnly` prop to make the color picker component read-only.

### Save Swatch

<ExampleTabs name="color-picker-with-save-swatch" />
