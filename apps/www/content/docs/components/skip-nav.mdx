## Usage

Skip Navigation link and destination container for screen readers and keyboard
users.

Per
[WebAIM.org on WCAG 2.4.1 (Bypass Blocks - Level A)](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.4.1),
because the main content is not always the first section that the user
encounters on a page, it is strongly recommended to include a skip link for
users to be able to bypass content that is present on multiple pages. Navigation
links are the most common skipped.

> A user with a screen reader or specialized software could skip content via the
> headings or `main` region, but this is not sufficient for sighted users who
> primarily use a keyboard.

```jsx
import { SkipNavContent, SkipNavLink } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<SkipNavLink>Skip to content</SkipNavLink>
<SkipNavContent />
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

The `SkipNavLink` component ideally needs to be one of the first items a user
encounters when they begin navigating a page after load. Therefore, it is
recommended to place it as high as possible in the app.

It renders an `a` tag and automatically creates a link with an `href` attribute
that will point to `SkipNavContent`.

The `SkipNavContent` component is used as a target for the link to place
keyboard focus on the first piece of main content. It renders a `div` and can
either be a self-closing component, or wrap the main content.

### Custom ID

You can supply a custom id value using the `id` prop but you will have to use
this prop and value in both components, or they will not match.

<ExampleTabs name="skip-nav-custom-id" />

### With Main Content

The `SkipNavContent` component can wrap your main content area to ensure proper
focus management.

<ExampleTabs name="skip-nav-with-content" />

## In Action

You can see these components in action on this page!

1. Place your cursor in the browser's address bar.
2. Remove any id queries from the url. (i.e. `/skip-nav#usage`)
3. Hit `Enter` to reload the page, then hit `Tab`. The Skip Nav link will appear
   in the upper left.
4. Hitting `Enter` on the link will take you to the top of the docs content.
