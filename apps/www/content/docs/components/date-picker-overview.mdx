## Component Architecture

The DatePicker is built with a composable structure that gives you full control
over the layout and appearance.

### Root Component

The `DatePicker.Root` is the main container that manages all state and provides
context to child components. It accepts props for controlling selection mode,
date constraints, localization, and more.

**Key Props:**

- `value` - The currently selected date(s)
- `defaultValue` - Initial selected date(s)
- `onValueChange` - Callback when selection changes
- `selectionMode` - "single" | "multiple" | "range"
- `locale` - Language for calendar display
- `min` / `max` - Date constraints
- `disabled` - Disable the entire picker
