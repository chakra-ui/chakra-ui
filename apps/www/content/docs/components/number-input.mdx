## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`number-input` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add number-input
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `NumberInput`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  NumberInputField,
  NumberInputLabel,
  NumberInputRoot,
} from "@/components/ui/number-input"
```

```jsx
<NumberInputRoot>
  <NumberInputLabel />
  <NumberInputField />
</NumberInputRoot>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the number input.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-sizes" />

### Formatting

Use the `formatOptions` prop to format the number input value. The value of this
maps to `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` and is applied based on the current locale.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-format-options" />

### Min and Max

Use the `min` and `max` props to set the minimum and maximum values of the
number input.

If value entered is less than `min` or greater than `max`, the value will be
clamped to the nearest boundary on blur, or enter key press.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-min-max" />

### Step

Use the `step` prop to change the increment or decrement interval of the number
input.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-step" />

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the value of the number
input.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-controlled" />

### Mobile Stepper

Use the `StepperInput` component to create a stepper input for mobile devices.

> You can also apply `spinOnPress: false` to disable the spin functionality.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-stepper" />

### Mouse Wheel

Use the `allowMouseWheel` prop to enable or disable the mouse wheel to change

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-mouse-wheel" />

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable the number input.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-disabled" />

### Invalid

Use the `Field` component and pass the `invalid` prop to indicate that the
number input is invalid.

<ExampleTabs name="number-input-with-invalid" />

### Helper Text

Use the `Field` component and pass the `helperText` prop to add helper text to
the number input.
