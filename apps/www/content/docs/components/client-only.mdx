<ExampleTabs name="client-only-basic" />

## Usage

```jsx
import { ClientOnly, Skeleton } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<ClientOnly>
  <ColorModeButton />
</ClientOnly>
```

## Examples

### Fallback

Use the `fallback` prop to render a loading state while the client-side content
is being prepared.

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-with-fallback" />

### Render Prop (Recommended)

When your component accesses browser-only APIs (like `window`, `document`, or
`localStorage`), use the render prop pattern to prevent server-side rendering
issues:

<ExampleTabs name="client-only-render-prop" />

This pattern ensures that components accessing browser APIs are only evaluated
on the client side, preventing hydration mismatches and server-side errors.

> It can also be used for rendering heavy components that are not needed on the
> server side.

### Direct Children (Use with Caution)

While you can pass components directly as children, be careful with components
that access browser APIs:

```tsx
/* ❌ This may cause server-side errors */
<ClientOnly fallback={<Skeleton />}>
  <ComponentThatUsesWindow />
</ClientOnly>

/* ✅ This is safe */
<ClientOnly fallback={<Skeleton />}>
  {() => <ComponentThatUsesWindow />}
</ClientOnly>
```

## Props

These props can be passed to the `ClientOnly` component.

<PropTable component="ClientOnly" part="ClientOnly" />
