## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`accordion` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add accordion
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Accordion`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionItemContent,
  AccordionItemTrigger,
  AccordionRoot,
} from "@/components/ui/accordion"
```

```jsx
<AccordionRoot>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionItemTrigger />
    <AccordionItemContent />
  </AccordionItem>
</AccordionRoot>
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Set the accordion that shows up by default.

<ExampleTabs name="accordion-controlled" />

### With Icon

Use the `AccordionItemIcon` to add an icon to each accordion item.

<ExampleTabs name="accordion-with-icon" />

### Expand Multiple Items

Use the `multiple` prop to allow multiple items to be expanded at once.

<ExampleTabs name="accordion-with-multiple" />

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the accordion.

<ExampleTabs name="accordion-sizes" />

### Variants

Use the `variant` prop to change the visual style of the accordion. Values can
be either `outline`, `elevated`, `contained` or `plain`.

<ExampleTabs name="accordion-variants" />

### Disabled Item

Pass the `disabled` prop to disable an accordion item to prevent it from being
expanded or collapsed.
