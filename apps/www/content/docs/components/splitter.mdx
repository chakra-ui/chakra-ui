  The Splitter component allows users to resize panels by dragging a handle
  between them. It supports horizontal, vertical, multi-panel, controlled, and
  store-driven configurations.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Splitter } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Splitter.Root>
  <Splitter.Panel />
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerSeparator />
    <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator />
  </Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
  <Splitter.Panel />
</Splitter.Root>
```

## Shortcuts

The `Splitter` component provides shortcuts for common use cases.

### SplitterResizeTrigger

The `Splitter.ResizeTrigger` renders the `Splitter.ResizeTriggerSeparator` and
`Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator` within it by default.

Writing this:

```jsx
<Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" />
```

is shorthand for writing this if you don't need to customize the separator or
indicator:

```jsx
<Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b">
  <Splitter.ResizeTriggerSeparator />
  <Splitter.ResizeTriggerIndicator />
</Splitter.ResizeTrigger>
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Use `onResize` and `size` props to manage panel sizes programmatically.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-controlled" />

### Store

Use the `RootProvider` with the `useSplitter` hook to manage and control the
splitter state from outside the component.

> Use `RootProvider + useSplitter` or `Root`, not both.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-with-store" />

### Vertical

Set `orientation="vertical"` for stacked panels that resize vertically.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-vertical" />

### Responsive Orientation

Use the `useBreakpointValue` hook to change the splitter orientation based on
screen size. This example shows a vertical splitter on mobile devices and a
horizontal splitter on larger screens.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-responsive-orientation" />

### Multiple Panels

Create layouts with more than two resizable panels.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-multiple-panels" />

### Collapsible Panels

Panels can be made collapsible by setting the `collapsible` and `collapsedSize`
properties on a panel in the `panels` array. This allows users to collapse
panels to a defined minimum size.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-collapsible" />

### Min/Max Constraints

Set `minSize` and `maxSize` on panels to constrain their resizable range and
prevent resizing beyond these boundaries.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-min-max-constraints" />

### Nested Panels

You can nest splitters inside panels to create more complex layouts. Each nested
splitter can have its own orientation, sizes, and behaviors independent of the
parent splitter.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-nested" />

### Storage

You can set a `defaultSize` and pair it with a storage solution, such as
`useLocalStorage`, to save users’ panel size preferences. This ensures that
panel layouts persist across sessions. Alternatively, you can use cookies or
other storage mechanisms depending on your needs.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-with-storage" />

### Disabled Resize

You can disable a panel's resize by setting `disabled` on the ResizeTrigger.
This is useful if certain panels should remain fixed while allowing others to
resize.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-disabled" />

### Separator Only

Customize the resize trigger to show only the separator without the indicator.
This creates a minimal, clean appearance while maintaining full resize
functionality.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-separator-only" />

### Reset on Double Click

Use `Splitter.Context` to access the splitter context and add a double-click
handler to the resize trigger. This example resets panel sizes to their default
values when the resize handle is double-clicked.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-reset-on-double-click" />

### Resize Events

Track resize events using `onResizeStart`, `onResize`, and `onResizeEnd` props.
This example logs all resize events with timestamps and panel sizes, useful for
debugging or implementing custom resize behavior.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-resize-events" />

### Keyboard Resize

The `Splitter` supports keyboard-based resizing for accessibility and precise
control:

- Press Tab until the resize handle is focused.

- Use Arrow keys to resize panels.

- Hold Shift for larger steps.

- Press Home / End to jump to minimum or maximum sizes.

- Control the step size using the `keyboardResizeBy` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-keyboard-resize" />

### Conditional Rendering

This example shows a **horizontal splitter** where panels can be shown or hidden
dynamically. Use the buttons above the splitter to toggle the left and right
panels—perfect for layouts where certain sections may not always be needed.

The splitter automatically adjusts the remaining panels when one is hidden,
keeping everything responsive. Initial panel sizes are set with `defaultSize`,
and `minSize` ensures panels never shrink too small.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-conditional-rendering" />

### Dynamic Panels

Add or remove panels dynamically while maintaining relative proportions. This
example demonstrates how to manage panel state and redistribute sizes when
panels are added or removed.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-dynamic-panel" />

### Composition

A real-world VS Code-like layout demonstrating nested splitters with different
orientations, collapsible panels, and integrated code editing.

## Guides

### Accessing Splitter Context

When you need to programmatically control the splitter, you can access the
splitter context and its methods in two ways:

- using the `Splitter.Context` render prop
- using the `useSplitterContext` hook

#### Using Splitter.Context Render Prop

Use `Splitter.Context` as a render prop to access the context within the
component tree:

```tsx
<Splitter.Root defaultSize={[50, 50]} panels={[{ id: "a" }, { id: "b" }]}>
  <Splitter.Panel id="a">Panel A</Splitter.Panel>

  <Splitter.Context>
    {(context) => (
      <Splitter.ResizeTrigger
        id="a:b"
        onDoubleClick={() => {
          context.resetSizes()
        }}
      />
    )}
  </Splitter.Context>

  <Splitter.Panel id="b">Panel B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>
```

#### Using useSplitterContext Hook

Alternatively, use the `useSplitterContext` hook in a child component:

```tsx
import { useSplitterContext } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const ResetButton = () => {
  const splitter = useSplitterContext()
  return <button onClick={() => splitter.resetSizes()}>Reset Sizes</button>
}

const Demo = () => (
  <Splitter.Root defaultSize={[50, 50]} panels={[{ id: "a" }, { id: "b" }]}>
    <Splitter.Panel id="a">Panel A</Splitter.Panel>
    <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" />
    <Splitter.Panel id="b">
      <ResetButton />
    </Splitter.Panel>
  </Splitter.Root>
)
```

The context object (from either method) includes:

- **`resetSizes()`**: Reset all panels to their default sizes
- **`setSize(sizes)`**: Set panel sizes programmatically
- **`collapsePanel(id)`**: Collapse a specific panel
- **`expandPanel(id)`**: Expand a collapsed panel
- **`isPanelCollapsed(id)`**: Check if a panel is collapsed
- **`getItems()`**: Get the current items (panels and handles)
- **`size`**: Current panel sizes array
