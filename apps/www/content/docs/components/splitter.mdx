## Usage

```jsx
import { Splitter } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Splitter.Root>
  <Splitter.Panel id="a">Panel A</Splitter.Panel>
  <Splitter.ResizeTrigger id="a:b" aria-label="Resize panels" />
  <Splitter.Panel id="b">Panel B</Splitter.Panel>
</Splitter.Root>
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Use `onResize` and `size` props to manage panel sizes programmatically.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-controlled" />

### Store

Use the `RootProvider` with the `useSplitter` hook to manage and control the
splitter state from outside the component.

> Use `RootProvider + useSplitter` or `Root`, not both.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-with-store" />

### Vertical

Set `orientation="vertical"` for stacked panels that resize vertically.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-vertical" />

### Multiple Panels

Create layouts with more than two resizable panels.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-multiple-panels" />

### Collapsible Panels

Panels can be made collapsible by setting the `collapsible` and `collapsedSize`
properties on a panel in the `panels` array. This allows users to collapse
panels to a defined minimum size.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-collapsible" />

### Nested Panels

You can nest splitters inside panels to create more complex layouts. Each nested
splitter can have its own orientation, sizes, and behaviors independent of the
parent splitter.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-nested" />

### Storage

You can set a `defaultSize` and pair it with a storage solution, such as
`useLocalStorage`, to save users’ panel size preferences. This ensures that
panel layouts persist across sessions. Alternatively, you can use cookies or
other storage mechanisms depending on your needs.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-with-storage" />

### Disabled Resize

You can disable a panel's resize by setting `disabled` on the ResizeTrigger.
This is useful if certain panels should remain fixed while allowing others to
resize.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-disabled" />

### Keyboard Resize

The `Splitter` supports keyboard-based resizing for accessibility and precise
control:

- Press Tab until the resize handle is focused.

- Use Arrow keys to resize panels.

- Hold Shift for larger steps.

- Press Home / End to jump to minimum or maximum sizes.

- Control the step size using the `keyboardResizeBy` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-keyboard-resize" />

### Conditional Rendering

This example shows a **horizontal splitter** where panels can be shown or hidden
dynamically. Use the buttons above the splitter to toggle the left and right
panels—perfect for layouts where certain sections may not always be needed.

The splitter automatically adjusts the remaining panels when one is hidden,
keeping everything responsive. Initial panel sizes are set with `defaultSize`,
and `minSize` ensures panels never shrink too small.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-conditional-rendering" />

### Dynamic Panels

Add or remove panels dynamically while maintaining relative proportions. This
example demonstrates how to manage panel state and redistribute sizes when
panels are added or removed.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-dynamic-panel" />

### Composition

A real-world VS Code-like layout demonstrating nested splitters with different
orientations, collapsible panels, and integrated code editing. Shows how to
build complex, production-ready layouts with file explorers, editors, and
terminals.
