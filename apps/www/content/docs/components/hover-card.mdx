<ExampleTabs name="hover-card-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`hover-card` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add hover-card
```

The snippet includes component compositions based on the `HoverCard` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  HoverCardArrow,
  HoverCardContent,
  HoverCardRoot,
  HoverCardTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
```

```jsx
<HoverCardRoot>
  <HoverCardTrigger />
  <HoverCardContent>
    <HoverCardArrow />
  </HoverCardContent>
</HoverCardRoot>
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` to control the visibility of the hover card.

<ExampleTabs name="hover-card-controlled" />

### Delays

Control the open and close delays using the `openDelay` and `closeDelay` props.

<ExampleTabs name="hover-card-with-delay" />

### Placement

Use the `positioning.placement` prop to configure the underlying `floating-ui`
positioning logic.

<ExampleTabs name="hover-card-with-placement" />

### Within Dialog

Here's an example of how to use the `HoverCard` within a `Dialog` component.

> Due to the focus trap within the dialog, it's important to change the portal
> target from the document's body to the dialog's content.

<ExampleTabs name="hover-card-in-dialog" />

## Accessibility

HoverCard should be used solely for supplementary information that is not
essential for understanding the context.

It is inaccessible to screen readers and cannot be activated via keyboard, so
avoid placing crucial content within it.

## Props

<PropTable component="HoverCard" part="Root" />
