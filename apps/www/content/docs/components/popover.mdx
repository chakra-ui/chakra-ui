<ExampleTabs name="popover-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`popover` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add popover
```

The snippet includes component compositions based on the `Popover` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  PopoverBody,
  PopoverContent,
  PopoverRoot,
  PopoverTitle,
  PopoverTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/popover"
```

```jsx
<PopoverRoot>
  <PopoverTrigger />
  <PopoverContent>
    <PopoverBody>
      <PopoverTitle />
    </PopoverBody>
  </PopoverContent>
</PopoverRoot>
```

## Examples

### Controlled

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` to control the visibility of the popover.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-controlled" />

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the popover component.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-sizes" />

### Lazy Mount

Use the `lazyMounted` and/or `unmountOnExit` prop to defer the mounting of the
popover content until it's opened.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-lazy-mounted" />

### Placement

Use the `positioning.placement` prop to configure the underlying `floating-ui`
positioning logic.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-placement" />

### Offset

Use the `positioning.offset` prop to adjust the position of the popover content.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-offset" />

### Same Width

Use the `positioning.sameWidth` prop to make the popover content the same width
as the trigger.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-same-width" />

### Nested Popover

When nesting overlay elements like popover, select, menu, inside of the popover,
set `portalled=false` on them.

Here's an example of a popover inside another popover.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-nested" />

### Initial Focus

Use the `initialFocusEl` prop to set the initial focus of the popover content.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-initial-focus" />

### Form

Here's an example of a popover with a form inside.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-form" />

### Custom Background

Use the `--popover-bg` CSS variable to change the background color of the
popover content and its arrow.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-with-custom-bg" />

### Without Snippet

If you don't want to use the snippet, you can use the `Popover` component from
the `@chakra-ui/react` package.

<ExampleTabs name="popover-without-snippet" />

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="Popover" part="Root" />
