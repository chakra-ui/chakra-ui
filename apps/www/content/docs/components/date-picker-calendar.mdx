## Basic Usage

> 💡 **Inline Calendar:** The calendar is always visible on the page, without a
> popup. This is ideal for dashboards, booking flows, or any scenario where
> persistent date selection is needed.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline" />

```tsx
<DatePicker.Root inline>
  <DatePicker.Content>
    <DatePicker.Header />
    <DatePicker.DayView />
    <DatePicker.MonthView />
    <DatePicker.YearView />
  </DatePicker.Content>
</DatePicker.Root>
```

## Examples

### Range Selection

Select a start and end date directly from the always-visible calendar. Useful
for booking periods, event planning, or any scenario where a date range is
required.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-range-selection" />

### Multi Selection

Pick multiple individual dates at once, such as marking holidays, unavailable
days, or custom events. The inline calendar makes it easy to see all selected
dates at a glance.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-multi-selection" />
