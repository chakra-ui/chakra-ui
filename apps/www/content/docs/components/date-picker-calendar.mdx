The inline calendar variant of DatePicker renders the calendar directly on the
page without requiring user interaction to reveal it. This is achieved by adding
the `inline` prop to `DatePicker.Root`.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline" />

## Usage

```tsx
import { DatePicker } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```tsx
<DatePicker.Root inline>
  <DatePicker.Content>
    <DatePicker.Header />
    <DatePicker.DayView />
    <DatePicker.MonthView />
    <DatePicker.YearView />
  </DatePicker.Content>
</DatePicker.Root>
```

The inline calendar differs from the standard DatePicker in several ways:

- No input field or trigger button required
- Calendar is always visible without user interaction
- No `Portal` or `Positioner` components needed
- Simpler component structure focused on the calendar itself

## When to Use

The inline calendar is well-suited for:

- **Booking interfaces** - Hotel, flight, or appointment scheduling where users
  need to see availability at a glance
- **Dashboard widgets** - Date-based filtering or navigation in admin panels
- **Event calendars** - Selecting dates for events or deadlines
- **Embedded experiences** - When the calendar should be part of the page layout
  rather than a popup overlay

## Examples

### Range Selection

Enable date range selection for booking periods, event spans, or any scenario
requiring a start and end date. Users click to set the start date, then click
again to set the end date.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-range-selection" />

The range selection mode visually highlights the selected range and all dates
between the start and end, making it easy for users to see their selection.

---

### Multi Selection

Allow users to select multiple individual dates that are not necessarily
consecutive. This is useful for marking specific dates like holidays,
availability, or important events.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-multi-selection" />

Each selected date is highlighted independently, and users can click a selected
date again to deselect it.

---

### Controlled

Use the `value` and `onValueChange` props to control the selected date
programmatically. This enables synchronization with external state, form
libraries, or other UI components.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-controlled" />

Controlled mode is essential when you need to:

- Display the selected date elsewhere in your UI
- Validate or transform dates before accepting them
- Reset or update the selection based on external events
- Integrate with form state management

---

### Default Value

Pre-select a date when the calendar first renders using `defaultValue`. This is
useful for editing existing data or suggesting a common selection.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-default-value" />

---

### Min and Max Dates

Restrict the selectable date range using `min` and `max` props. Dates outside
this range will be disabled and cannot be selected.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-min-max" />

Common use cases include:

- Preventing selection of past dates for future bookings
- Limiting selection to a specific month or quarter
- Enforcing business rules around date constraints

---

### Unavailable Dates

Use `isDateUnavailable` to disable specific dates based on custom logic. This is
more flexible than min/max when you need to disable non-contiguous dates like
weekends or holidays.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-unavailable" />

The function receives a `DateValue` and should return `true` for dates that
should be unavailable.

---

### Multiple Months

Display two or more months side by side using `numOfMonths` and multiple
`DayView` components with `offset` props. This provides better context for range
selection across month boundaries.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-multiple-months" />

---

### Locale

Customize the calendar for different languages and regional formats using the
`locale` and `startOfWeek` props. The calendar will display month names, day
abbreviations, and date formats according to the specified locale.

<ExampleTabs name="date-picker-inline-locale" />

## Props

The inline calendar uses the same props as the standard DatePicker. Key props
for inline usage:

| `isDateUnavailable` | `(date: DateValue) => boolean`      | Function to disable specific dates     |

| `startOfWeek`       | `number`                            | First day of week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday) |
