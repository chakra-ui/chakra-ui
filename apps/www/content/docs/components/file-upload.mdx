<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-basic" />

## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`file-upload` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add file-upload
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `FileUpload`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  FileUploadList,
  FileUploadRoot,
  FileUploadTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/file-upload"
```

```jsx
<FileUploadRoot>
  <FileUploadTrigger>
    <Button>
      <HiUpload /> Upload file
    </Button>
  </FileUploadTrigger>
  <FileUploadList />
</FileUploadRoot>
```

## Examples

### Directory

Use the `directory` prop to allow selecting a directory instead of a file.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-directory" />

### Media Capture

Use the `capture` prop to select and upload files from different environments
and media types.

> **Note:** This is
> [not fully supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlinputelement_capture) in
> all browsers.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-media-capture" />

### Multiple Files

Upload multiple files at once by using the `maxFiles` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-multiple" />

### Dropzone

Drop multiple files inside the dropzone and use the `maxFiles` prop to set the
number of files that can be uploaded at once.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-dropzone" />

### Input

Use the `FileInput` component to create a trigger that looks like a text input.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-input" />

### Clearable

Here's an example of a clearable file upload input.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-input-clear" />

### Accepted Files

Define the accepted files for upload using the `accept` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-accepted-files" />

### Pasting Files

Here's an example of handling files pasted from the clipboard.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-paste-event" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the file upload is to use the `RootProvider`
component and the `useFileUpload` store hook.

This way you can access the file upload state and methods from outside the file
upload.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-store" />

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="FileUpload" part="Root" />
