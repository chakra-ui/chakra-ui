## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`file-upload` snippet

```sh
chakra snippet add file-upload
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `FileUpload`
component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  FileUploadList,
  FileUploadRoot,
  FileUploadTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/file-upload"
```

```jsx
<FileUploadRoot>
  <FileUploadTrigger>
    <Button>
      <HiUpload /> Upload file
    </Button>
  </FileUploadTrigger>
  <FileUploadList />
</FileUploadRoot>
```

## Examples

### Directory

Use the `directory` prop to allow selecting a directory instead of a file.

environments and media types.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-media-capture" />

### Multiple Files

Upload multiple files at once by using the `maxFiles` prop.

number of files that can be uploaded at once.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-dropzone" />
