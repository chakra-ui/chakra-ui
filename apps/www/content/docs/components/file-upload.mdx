<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-basic" />

## Usage

```jsx
import { FileUpload } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<FileUpload.Root>
  <FileUpload.HiddenInput />
  <FileUpload.Label />
  <FileUpload.Dropzone>
    <FileUpload.DropzoneContent />
  </FileUpload.Dropzone>
  <FileUpload.Trigger />
  <FileUpload.ItemGroup>
    <FileUpload.Item>
      <FileUpload.ItemPreview />
      <FileUpload.ItemFileName />
      <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
      <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger />
    </FileUpload.Item>
  </FileUpload.ItemGroup>
</FileUpload.Root>
```

## Shortcuts

The `FileUpload` component also provides a set of shortcuts for common use
cases.

### FileUploadItems

By default, the `FileUploadItems` shortcut renders the list of uploaded files.

This works:

```tsx
<FileUpload.ItemGroup>
  <FileUpload.Context>
    {({ acceptedFiles }) =>
      acceptedFiles.map((file) => (
        <FileUpload.Item key={file.name} file={file}>
          <FileUpload.ItemPreview />
          <FileUpload.ItemName />
          <FileUpload.ItemSizeText />
          <FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger />
        </FileUpload.Item>
      ))
    }
  </FileUpload.Context>
</FileUpload.ItemGroup>
```

This might be more concise, if you don't need to customize the file upload
items:

```tsx
<FileUpload.ItemGroup>
  <FileUpload.Items />
</FileUpload.ItemGroup>
```

### FileUploadList

The `FileUploadList` shortcut renders the list of uploaded files. It composes
the `FileUpload.ItemGroup` and `FileUpload.Items` components.

```tsx
<FileUpload.List />
```

is the same as:

```tsx
<FileUpload.ItemGroup>
  <FileUpload.Items />
</FileUpload.ItemGroup>
```

## Examples

### Accepted Files

Define the accepted files for upload using the `accept` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-accepted-files" />

### Multiple Files

Upload multiple files at once by using the `maxFiles` prop.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-multiple" />

### Custom Preview

Here's an example of how to show a custom image preview for files.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-custom-preview" />

### Directory

Use the `directory` prop to allow selecting a directory instead of a file.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-directory" />

### Media Capture

Use the `capture` prop to select and upload files from different environments
and media types.

> **Note:** This is
> [not fully supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlinputelement_capture) in
> all browsers.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-media-capture" />

### Dropzone

Drop multiple files inside the dropzone and use the `maxFiles` prop to set the
number of files that can be uploaded at once.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-dropzone" />

### Conditional Dropzone

Hide the dropzone when the maximum number of files has been reached by using
`useFileUploadContext` to access the accepted files count.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-conditional-dropzone" />

### Input

Use the `FileInput` component to create a trigger that looks like a text input.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-input" />

### Clearable

Here's an example of a clearable file upload input.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-input-clear" />

### Pasting Files

Here's an example of handling files pasted from the clipboard.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-paste-event" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the file upload is to use the `RootProvider`
component and the `useFileUpload` store hook.

This way you can access the file upload state and methods from outside the file
upload.

<ExampleTabs name="file-upload-with-store" />

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="FileUpload" part="Root" />

## Explorer

Explore the `File Upload` component parts interactively. Click on parts in the
sidebar to highlight them in the preview.

<Explorer name="file-upload-explorer" />
