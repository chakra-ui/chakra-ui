## Setup

If you don't already have the snippet, run the following command to add the
`dialog` snippet

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli snippet add dialog
```

The snippet includes a closed component composition for the `Dialog` component.

## Usage

```jsx
import {
  DialogBody,
  DialogCloseTrigger,
  DialogContent,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogRoot,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog"
```

```jsx
<DialogRoot>
  <DialogBackdrop />
  <DialogTrigger />
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogCloseTrigger />
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle />
    </DialogHeader>
    <DialogBody />
    <DialogFooter />
  </DialogContent>
</DialogRoot>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-sizes" />

### Cover

Use the `size="cover"` prop to make the dialog component cover the entire screen
while revealing a small portion of the page behind.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-cover" />

### Fullscreen

Use the `size="full"` prop to make the dialog component take up the entire
screen.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-fullscreen" />

### Placement

Use the `placement` prop to change the placement of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-placement" />

### Controlled

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` prop to control the visibility of the dialog
component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the dialog is to use the `RootProvider` component
and the `useDialog` store hook.

This way you can access the dialog state and methods from outside the dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-store" />

### Context

Use the `DialogContext` component to access the dialog state and methods from
outside the dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-context" />

### Initial Focus

Use the `initialFocusEl` prop to set the initial focus of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-initial-focus" />

### Inside Scroll

Use the `scrollBehavior=inside` prop to change the scroll behavior of the dialog
when its content overflows.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-inside-scroll" />

### Outside Scroll

Use the `scrollBehavior=outside` prop to change the scroll behavior of the
dialog when its content overflows.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-outside-scroll" />

### Motion Preset

Use the `motionPreset` prop to change the animation of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-motion-preset" />

### Alert Dialog

Set the `role: "alertdialog"` prop to change the dialog component to an alert
dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-role" />

### Close Button Outside

Here's an example of how to customize the `DialogCloseTrigger` component to
position the close button outside the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-close-outside" />

component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-datalist" />
