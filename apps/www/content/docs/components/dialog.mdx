## Usage

```tsx
import { Dialog } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```tsx
<Dialog.Root>
  <Dialog.Trigger />
  <Dialog.Backdrop />
  <Dialog.Positioner>
    <Dialog.Content>
      <Dialog.CloseTrigger />
      <Dialog.Header>
        <Dialog.Title />
      </Dialog.Header>
      <Dialog.Body />
      <Dialog.Footer />
    </Dialog.Content>
  </Dialog.Positioner>
</Dialog.Root>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to change the size of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-sizes" />

### Cover

Use the `size="cover"` prop to make the dialog component cover the entire screen
while revealing a small portion of the page behind.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-cover" />

### Fullscreen

Use the `size="full"` prop to make the dialog component take up the entire
screen.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-fullscreen" />

### Responsive Size

Use responsive values for the `size` prop to make the dialog adapt to different
screen sizes.

We recommend using exact breakpoints values instead of using a `base` to ensure
styles are properly contained.

```tsx
// ❌ Might cause a style leak between the breakpoints
<Dialog.Root size={{ base: "full", md: "lg" }}>{/* ... */}</Dialog.Root>

// Works ✅
<Dialog.Root size={{ mdDown: "full", md: "lg" }}>{/* ... */}</Dialog.Root>
```

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-responsive-size" />

### Placement

Use the `placement` prop to change the placement of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-placement" />

### Controlled

Use the `open` and `onOpenChange` prop to control the visibility of the dialog
component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-controlled" />

### Store

An alternative way to control the dialog is to use the `RootProvider` component
and the `useDialog` store hook.

This way you can access the dialog state and methods from outside the dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-store" />

### Context

Use the `DialogContext` component to access the dialog state and methods from
outside the dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-context" />

### Nested Dialogs

You can nest dialogs by using the `Dialog.Root` component inside another
`Dialog.Root` component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-nested" />

### Open From Popover

Dialogs can be triggered from within a popover. The dialog will appear above the
popover thanks to the unified z-index system.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-open-from-popover" />

### Open From Menu

Use a controlled dialog to open it from a menu item action, like a delete
confirmation.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-open-from-menu" />

### Initial Focus

Use the `initialFocusEl` prop to set the initial focus of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-initial-focus" />

### Inside Scroll

Use the `scrollBehavior=inside` prop to change the scroll behavior of the dialog
when its content overflows.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-inside-scroll" />

### Outside Scroll

Use the `scrollBehavior=outside` prop to change the scroll behavior of the
dialog when its content overflows.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-outside-scroll" />

### Motion Preset

Use the `motionPreset` prop to change the animation of the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-motion-preset" />

### Alert Dialog

Set the `role: "alertdialog"` prop to change the dialog component to an alert
dialog.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-role" />

### Close Button Outside

Here's an example of how to customize the `Dialog.CloseTrigger` component to
position the close button outside the dialog component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-close-outside" />

### Non-Modal Dialog

We don't recommend using a non-modal dialog due to the accessibility concerns
they present. In event you need it, here's what you can do:

- set the `modal` prop to `false`
- set `pointerEvents` to `none` on the `Dialog.Positioner` component
- (optional)set the `closeOnInteractOutside` prop to `false`

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-non-modal" />

### DataList

Here's an example of how to compose the dialog component with the `DataList`
component.

<ExampleTabs name="dialog-with-datalist" />

## Accessibility

The Dialog component follows the
[WAI-ARIA Dialog Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/).

### Keyboard Support

- `Tab` - Moves focus to the next focusable element inside the dialog
- `Shift + Tab` - Moves focus to the previous focusable element inside the
  dialog
- `Esc` - Closes the dialog (when `closeOnEscape` is true)
- `Enter` - Activates the focused button or element

### Focus Management

- When the dialog opens, focus moves to the first focusable element (or the
  element specified by `initialFocusEl`)
- Focus is trapped within the dialog while it's open
- When the dialog closes, focus returns to the element that triggered it

### ARIA Attributes

- The dialog container has `role="dialog"` (or `role="alertdialog"` when
  specified)
- The dialog is labeled using `aria-labelledby` pointing to the `Dialog.Title`
- The dialog content is described using `aria-describedby` pointing to the
  `Dialog.Body`
- The backdrop has `aria-hidden="true"` to hide it from screen readers

## Props

### Root

<PropTable component="Dialog" part="Root" />
