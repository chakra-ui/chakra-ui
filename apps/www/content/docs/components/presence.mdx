<ExampleTabs name="presence-fade" />

## Usage

```jsx
import { Presence } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<Presence present={true}>
  <div>Presence content</div>
</Presence>
```

Think of `Presence` like the `AnimatePresence` component from Framer Motion,
except that it's built for CSS animations instead.

The key things to note:

- the `present` prop is a boolean that controls the presence state of the
  component.
- the `_open` condition is used to style the open state.
- the `_closed` condition is used to style the closed state.

## Examples

### Fade

Setting the animation name to `fade-in` and `fade-out`, the component will
animate the entry and exit of the element.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-fade" />

### Scale Fade

Using the animation styles `scale-fade-in` and `scale-fade-out`, the component
will animate the entry and exit of the element.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-scale-fade" />

### Slide Fade

Here's an example that uses the animation names `slide-from-bottom` and
`slide-to-bottom` to animate the entry and exit of the element.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-slide-fade" />

### Slide

Here's an example that uses the animation names `slide-from-bottom-full` and
`slide-to-bottom-full` to animate the entry and exit of the element.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-slide" />

### Lazy Mount

Use the `lazyMount` prop to delay the mount of the component until it's present.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-lazy-mount" />

### Unmount On Exit

Use the `unmountOnExit` prop to unmount the component when it's not present.

<ExampleTabs name="presence-unmount-on-exit" />
