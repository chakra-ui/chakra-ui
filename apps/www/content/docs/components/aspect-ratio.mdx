<ExampleTabs name="aspect-ratio-basic" />

## Usage

The `ratio` prop overrides the original aspect ratios of `AspectRatio`'s child
content, accepting only numeric values, not strings.

```jsx
import { AspectRatio } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

```jsx
<AspectRatio ratio={16 / 9}>
  <iframe
    title="naruto"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhBnZ6NPOY0"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</AspectRatio>
```

## Examples

### Video

original aspect ratio.

<ExampleTabs name="aspect-ratio-with-video" />

### Google Map

<ExampleTabs name="aspect-ratio-with-map" />

### Responsive

Here's an example of applying a responsive aspect ratio to a box.

<ExampleTabs name="aspect-ratio-responsive" />

## Props

These props can be passed to the `AspectRatio` component.

<PropTable component="AspectRatio" part="AspectRatio" />
Chakra UI also provides [predefined aspect ratio
tokens](/docs/theming/aspect-ratios) out of the box, including `square`,
`landscape`, `portrait`, `wide`, `ultrawide`, and `golden` that can be used with
components that support the `aspectRatio` CSS prop. They cannot currently be
used with the `ratio` prop that `AspectRatio` accepts.
