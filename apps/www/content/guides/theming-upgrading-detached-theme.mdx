## What's a Detached Theme?

When you run `npx @chakra-ui/cli eject`, the CLI copies the entire Chakra theme
into your project so you can customize it directly. This gives you full control,
but it also means you're on your own when it comes to keeping up with upstream
changes.

## Upgrading the Package

You can safely upgrade `@chakra-ui/react` to the latest version — the package
will work fine. But your ejected theme stays frozen at the version you copied it
from.

Here's what that means in practice:

- **New component recipes** won't exist in your theme unless you add them
- **Token updates** (new semantic tokens, adjusted values) won't apply
- **Styled-system bug fixes** will still apply automatically since they live in
  the package, not in your theme files

The runtime upgrades, but your theme data stays behind.

## Upgrade Strategies

### Minimal Upgrade

If you just want to move fast and fix what's broken:

1. Upgrade the package: `pnpm add @chakra-ui/react@latest`
2. Run your app and check for visual regressions
3. Add missing tokens or recipes only if something isn't rendering correctly

### Full Sync

If you want to stay close to upstream for long-term maintenance:

1. Upgrade the package: `pnpm add @chakra-ui/react@latest`
2. Diff your theme against the
   [current source](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/packages/react/src/theme)
3. Cherry-pick the changes you need — new tokens, updated values, new recipes
4. Run your app and visually verify everything looks right

### Switch to Overrides (Recommended)

If your theme has drifted far from upstream, or you'd rather stop syncing
manually, this is the way to go.

Instead of maintaining a full copy of the theme, use `createSystem()` with the
default config as a base and only override what you need:

```tsx
import { createSystem, defaultConfig } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const system = createSystem(defaultConfig, {
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      // your token overrides only
    },
    semanticTokens: {
      // your semantic token overrides only
    },
    recipes: {
      // your recipe overrides only
    },
  },
})
```

You inherit upstream changes automatically and only maintain your deltas. This
is the most maintainable approach and eliminates manual syncing entirely.

## Summary

| Question                          | Answer                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can I upgrade the package alone?  | Yes. Your frozen theme just won't have new additions.             |
| Do I need to manually sync?       | Yes, for new tokens/recipes/styles. Runtime fixes are automatic.  |
| What's the best long-term option? | Use `createSystem()` with overrides instead of a full theme fork. |
