When snippets are updated from Chakra UI, we document them in the changelog so
you're aware.

In your project, it's up to you to decide whether to update the snippets or not.
In most cases, you can check the
[snippet directory](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/apps/compositions/src/ui)
to see the changes.

When running the `npx chakra snippet add` command, the CLI will check for
existing snippets in your project and skip adding them if they already exist.

If you want to overwrite the existing snippets, run the following command:

```bash
npx chakra snippet add --force
```
