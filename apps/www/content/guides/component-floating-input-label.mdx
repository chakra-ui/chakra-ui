Floating labels conserve space in forms, particularly on mobile devices where
screen space is limited.

To add a floating label to an input component in Chakra UI, create a styled
input field using the `Field`, `Input`, and `Box` components with React state
management for reliable cross-device compatibility.

<ExampleTabs name="input-with-floating-label" />

## How it works

This implementation uses:

- **React state management**: Tracks focus and value states for consistent
  behavior
- **`data-float` attribute**: Applied conditionally for CSS-based styling
- **CSS attribute selectors**: `&[data-float]` for hardware-accelerated style
  changes

The state approach ensures the label floats correctly on all devices, including
mobile browsers where CSS-only solutions may fail due to autofill behavior.
