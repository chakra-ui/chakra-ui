The generated snippets by the Chakra UI CLI are placed in the `components/ui`
directory by default.

You can specify a custom directory by running the CLI with the `--outdir` flag.

```bash
npx chakra snippets --outdir ./components/custom
```

> To learn more about the CLI snippets command, refer to the
> [CLI](/docs/get-started/cli) docs.
