We recently launched Chakra UI version 3, which brings a huge set of changes,
improvements and new features.

With a major update like this, you may wonder, what has changed, what’s new, and
is migrating really worth it?

In this article, we'll take a deep dive into the key differences between version
2 and version 3. The goal is to give you a better understanding of version 3 and
help you decide if its time to migrate your projects.

## Simplified Installation

The installation process is one of the first noticeable differences. Previously,
you had to install multiple packages to get Chakra working in your project:

- `@chakra-ui/react`
- `@emotion/react`
- `@emotion/styled`
- `framer-motion`

But with **v3**, things are much simpler. You only need:

- `@chakra-ui/react`
- `@emotion/react`

This reduces the number of dependencies and results in a quicker setup.

**version 2:**

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

**version 3:**

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react

```

## New Provider Setup

In previous versions, you had to wrap your application with `ChakraProvider` to
access Chakra’s default theme. However, we've now replaced `ChakraProvider` with
the `Provider` component.

`Provider` composes the following:

- `ChakraProvider` from `@chakra-ui/react` for the styling system
- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` for color mode

**version 2:**

```jsx
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"

function App() {
  return <ChakraProvider>{/* the rest of your app */}</ChakraProvider>
}
```

**version 3:**

```jsx
import { Provider } from "@/components/ui/provider"

function App() {
  return <Provider>{/* the rest of your app */}</Provider>
}
```

## Component Snippets

A common pain point for developers is the repetitive task of building common UI
components. To solve this, we’ve introduced Component Snippets.

Snippets are pre-built components designed to accelerate your development
process.

With the new [Chakra CLI](/docs/get-started/cli#chakra-snippet) you can
instantly add ready-made components to your project with a single command.

```bash
# Add all snippets
chakra snippet add

# Add a specific snippet
chakra snippet add button

```

Once you run the command, you'll find the components neatly organized in a
`/components/ui` folder inside the **src** directory.

You can then import your desired component snippet directly from the components
folder

```bash
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

## New Components

We listened to you, our community, and in this version, we added 25+ new
components to enhance your development workflow.

Some of the new components include:

- File Upload
- Clipboard
- Timeline
- Password Input
- Segmented Control
- Toggle Tip
- Custom Select
- And a lot more

Check out all [components here](/docs/components/concepts/overview). Each new
component is built with the same focus on accessibility and design consistency
that Chakra UI is known for.

## Introduction of State Machines

One of the biggest updates in this version is the use of state machines for
logic-based components. Chakra UI v3 now uses Ark UI as the foundation for these
components.

State machines bring a new level of stability to Chakra UI components,
especially for applications that require complex and interactive user
interfaces.

While this isn’t something you’ll interact with directly as a user, it’s
important to know that using state machines under the hood significantly
improves the performance of components like modals, menus, popovers, and other
complex UI elements.

Now, you can expect more consistent behaviour across Chakra UI components.

## Streamlined Component Imports

In previous versions, you had to import multiple components and component parts
into your project.

For example, you had to manually import both `List` and `ListItem` separately

**version 2:**

```jsx
import { List, ListItem } from "@chakra-ui/react"

function App() {
  return (
    <List>
      <ListItem>Item 1</ListItem>
    </List>
  )
}
```

Version 3 offers a more cohesive API that keeps related components together. We
introduced a more organized approach to component imports, reducing the need for
multiple imports and making your codebase easier to maintain.

**version 3:**

```jsx
import { List } from "@chakra-ui/react"

function App() {
  return (
    <List.Root>
      <List.Item>Item 1</List.Item>
    </List.Root>
  )
}
```

Now, you only need to import `List` and use the object notation to compose the
other components.

This pattern of nesting primary components under a main “Root” container and
related subcomponents streamlines Chakra’s API and keeps your imports cleaner.

## Enhanced Theme Setup

We’ve reimagined the theme setup for better modularity. In previous versions,
themes were typically extended using the `extendTheme` function:

**version 2:**

```jsx
const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      100: "#f7fafc",
      900: "#1a202c",
    },
  },
})
```

In **v3**, the new approach leverages the `createSystem` function, where tokens
are defined under the `theme` key in your system config:

**version 3:**

```jsx
import { createSystem } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export const system = createSystem(defaultConfig, {
  theme: {
    tokens: {
      fonts: {
        heading: { value: `'Figtree', sans-serif` },
        body: { value: `'Figtree', sans-serif` },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

This new setup makes it easier to customize and scale your design system.

## Enhanced Design Tokens

In version 3, we’ve also updated our design tokens. You’ll notice changes in:

- **Colors**: The [color palette](/docs/theming/colors) has been expanded and
  fine-tuned for vibrancy and versatility. This ensures that your designs are
  more visually appealing and accessible.
- **Animations:** We’ve added more support for
  [animations](/docs/theming/animations) using vanilla css, making your app more
  perfomant.
- **Design Tokens**: Improved and more robust [tokens](/docs/theming/tokens) for
  better design consistency.
- **Introduction of Semantic Tokens:** We added built-in
  [semantic tokens](/docs/theming/semantic-tokens) to make it easier to map your
  design system to both light and dark color modes.

## Updated Props

Props have also received a
[major update](/docs/get-started/migration#prop-changes) in this version. A
great example is the `gap` prop, which now replaces the `spacing` prop for
`Stack` and similar components.

**version 2:**

```jsx
<Stack spacing={4}>
  <Box>Item 1</Box>
  <Box>Item 2</Box>
</Stack>
```

**version 3:**

```jsx
<Stack gap={4}>
  <Box>Item 1</Box>
  <Box>Item 2</Box>
</Stack>
```

This change is more in line with modern CSS practices and helps developers
manage spacing more efficiently, especially in flex and grid layouts.

Not only that, in v2, **boolean props** were typically prefixed with `is`, such
as `isDisabled`. In v3, this has been simplified by removing the `is` prefix.

**version 2:**

```jsx
<Button isDisabled>Click Me</Button>
```

**version 3:**

```jsx
<Button disabled>Click Me</Button>
```

This change makes prop names more intuitive and easier to read, aligning with
standard HTML practices.

## We Said Goodbye to `chakra-icons`

In a move towards simplicity, v3 has removed the `chakra-icons` package.
Instead, we encourage developers to use libraries like `lucide-react` or
`react-icons` for their icon needs.

This shift reduces dependency bloat and allows you to tap into a broader range
of icon options available in the React ecosystem.

## Go Faster With Chakra v3

If you’re currently using Chakra UI v2, now is a great time to consider
[migrating to version 3](/docs/get-started/migration).

The new features, such as component snippets, enhanced design tokens, and state
machine-powered components, are designed to streamline your development process
and improve your overall developer experience.
