We just shipped Chakra UI v3.32, and we're really excited about this one.

This release adds the **[Marquee](/docs/components/marquee)** component—a
long-awaited way to build smooth, infinitely scrolling content—and introduces
**[@chakra-ui/codemod](/docs/get-started/migration)**, a brand-new package that
automates the migration from Chakra UI v2 to v3.

We also landed a handful of important bug fixes for backdrop blur, collapse
animations, z-index stacking, and SSR breakpoints. Here's everything you need to
know.

## Marquee

If you've ever needed a scrolling ticker for client logos, testimonials, or
announcements, you know how fiddly it can be to get right. The new
[Marquee](/docs/components/marquee) component takes care of all of that—infinite
scrolling, speed, direction, auto-fill, pause on hover—so you can focus on the
content.

### Edge Gradients

Drop in `Marquee.Edge` to add smooth fade-out gradients on either side. A small
touch that makes the whole thing feel polished.

### Testimonials

Pair Marquee with Cards and you get a scrolling testimonial wall. Set
`pauseOnInteraction` so users can hover to read.

## Codemod: v2 → v3 in One Command

So, you've been putting off migrating from Chakra UI v2 to v3? Well, this one is
for you! We shipped `@chakra-ui/codemod`—a new package with **50+ automated
transforms** that does the heavy lifting for you.

```bash
npx @chakra-ui/codemod upgrade
```

Here's what it covers:

- **Components** — renames, restructured APIs, and changed props across 30+
  components (Accordion, Alert, Button, Dialog, Drawer, Menu, Select, Tabs, and
  many more)
- **Removed APIs** — swaps `forwardRef`, `useColorMode`, `StyleConfig`,
  `CircularProgress`, and `StackDivider` for their v3 equivalents
- **Props** — migrates `colorScheme` → `colorPalette`, boolean props, casing,
  gradients, spacing, and `as` prop patterns
- **Theme** — converts `extendTheme` to the new `createSystem` API
- **Types** — updates TypeScript system-type imports

It runs interactively, checks for a clean git tree, and supports `--dry` mode so
you can preview changes before committing.

## Bug Fixes

- **Backdrop Blur**: `backdropFilter="auto"` with `backdropBlur` now works on
  `Dialog.Backdrop`
- **Collapse Width**: the `collapse-width` keyframe was animating `height`
  instead of `width`—fixed
- **Z-Index Stacking**: `Dialog`, `Drawer`, `Menu`, and `HoverCard` now share a
  unified z-index so they stack correctly when nested
- **SSR Breakpoints**: `useBreakpointValue` now respects the `base` value during
  server-side rendering

## Upgrading

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

Everything in this release is backward compatible—no breaking changes or
migration needed. Just upgrade and start building.
