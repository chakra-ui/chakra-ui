The Chakra UI London Meetup was a special evening where we got to meet
face-to-face with many community members who we had only known through online
interactions in the open source world. Some of these connections spanned months
or even years, making the in-person gathering even more meaningful.

The event held on Thursday, November 28th, 2024 where we talked about Chakra UI
v3, and the future of Chakra UI.

The evening kicked off with light refreshments and chats. We exchanged ideas,
shared our favorite Chakra components, and of course, grabbed some stickers.

## Talks

We had three amazing talks that evening, each bringing unique insights into
Chakra UI's evolution and new features.

### Building Chakra UI v3

The opening talk was delivered by [Sage](https://x.com/thesegunadebayo), the
creator of Chakra UI. His talk provided a technical deep dive into the process
behind building Chakra UI v3, going from the logic layer to the presentation
layer.

Key highlights from the talk:

- **Component Design**: Using the slider component, Sage showcased how
  components are now built in Chakra UI. Going from the headless layer to the
  presentation layer, and leveraging state machines to handle interactions.

  - **Logic Layer** powered by [Zag.js](https://zagjs.com/)
  - **Headless UI Layer** handled by [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/)
  - **Presentation Layer** handled by Chakra's theming system

- **Component Anatomy**: He broke down the structure of Chakra UI components
  into separate parts so create a shared language for developers and designers.

- **Component API**: Sage emphasized how Chakra UI v3 leverages both open and
  closed component APIs to provide a flexible and consistent developer
  experience.
