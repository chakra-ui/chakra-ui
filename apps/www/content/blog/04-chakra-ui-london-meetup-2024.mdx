Last Thursday, 28th November, 2024, the Chakra UI community gathered in London
for our Meetup. It was an exciting time to engage and meet in real life some of
the members who we had connected with online for months and even years, thanks
to open source.

The evening kicked off with light refreshments and chats. We exchanged ideas,
shared our favorite Chakra components, and of course, grabbed some stickers.
