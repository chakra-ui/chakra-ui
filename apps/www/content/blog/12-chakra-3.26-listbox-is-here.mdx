We've just shipped Chakra UI v3.26! This release introduces the highly
anticipated **[Listbox](/docs/components/listbox)** component, bringing powerful
selection capabilities to Chakra UI.

This release also made important improvements to the
[CodeBlock](/docs/components/code-block) component and fixed several bugs across
more components.

## Listbox

The Listbox component is a versatile selection component that provides single
and multi-select functionality with support for filtering, grid layout, and
virtualization.

> Use it to build command palettes, searchable dropdowns, transfer lists, image
> galleries with selection, and much more.

<ExampleTabs name="listbox-basic" />

Here's a fun example of an emoji picker that composes the listbox with grid
collection.

<ExampleTabs name="listbox-with-emoji-grid" />

## Improvements

- **HoverCard**: Added support for `disabled` prop to conditionally disable
  hover interactions.

- **CodeBlock [Breaking Change]**: Theme configuration is now required when
  creating a Shiki adapter:

```ts
// Before
const adapter = createShikiAdapter({
  async load() { /* ... */ },
})

// After
const adapter = createShikiAdapter({
  async load() { /* ... */ },
  theme: {
    light: "github-light",
    dark: "github-dark",
  },
  // or theme: 'github-dark'
})
```

## Bug Fixes

- **Select & Menu**: Fixed disabled items being reachable via keyboard typeahead
- **Color Picker**: Fixed RTL mode rendering issues
- **Number Input**: Fixed pattern validation conflicts with formatted values,
  improved empty value handling, and added `data-scrubbing` attribute

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

Make sure to update your CodeBlock configuration if you're using the Shiki
adapter, as the theme property is now required.

We're excited to see what you build with the new Listbox component! Share your
