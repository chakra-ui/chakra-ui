We've just shipped Chakra UI v3.28! This release introduces the highly requested
**[TagsInput](/docs/components/tags-input)** component, bringing powerful
multi-value input capabilities to Chakra UI.

This release also includes comprehensive bug fixes and improvements across 14+
components, addressing edge cases in form handling, accessibility, and
cross-browser compatibility.

## TagsInput

The TagsInput component provides a robust interface for entering and managing
multiple values as tags. Think of it as a multi-value input with built-in
keyboard navigation, tag editing, validation, and deletion—all the complexity
handled for you.

Use it for skill selection, email recipients, keyword tagging, category
assignment, or any scenario where users need to input multiple discrete values.

### TagsInput + Combobox

TagsInput works seamlessly with Combobox to create an autocomplete tag
input—perfect for suggesting existing tags or categories as users type.

<ExampleTabs name="tags-input-with-combobox" />

## Collapsible Partial Height

The Collapsible component now supports `collapsedHeight` and `collapsedWidth`
props, allowing you to show a preview of the content when collapsed instead of
hiding it completely.

This is particularly useful for "Read more" patterns, content previews, or
showing the first few lines of a long text block before expanding.

## Quality Improvements

This release includes comprehensive bug fixes across 14+ components:

- **Checkbox**: Fixed `indeterminate` initial state and `api.checkedState`
  accuracy
- **Combobox**: Fixed initial value propagation in controlled single-select mode
- **Dialog & Popover**: Improved focus trap scope for elements with
  `aria-controls`
- **Listbox**: Fixed Enter key behavior when no item is highlighted
- **Number Input**: Fixed cursor jumping when typing in formatted values
- **Pagination**: Added `getPageUrl` prop for link-based pagination
- **Pin Input**: Fixed `Cmd+Backspace` and `Cmd+Delete` keyboard shortcuts
- **Scroll Area**: Fixed Safari RTL scrollbar positioning and resize tracking
- **Select**: Fixed `required` state accessibility
- **Slider**: Fixed dragging behavior when disabled mid-operation
- **Switch**: Fixed `data-active` attribute consistency with runtime `disabled`
  changes
- **Tabs**: Improved indicator positioning with `getBoundingClientRect()`

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

All improvements in this release are backward compatible—no breaking changes or
migration required.
