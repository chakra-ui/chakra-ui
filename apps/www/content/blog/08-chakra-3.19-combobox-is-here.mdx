Weâ€™ve just shipped Chakra UI v3.19! This release introduces two new components -
the **[Combobox](/docs/components/combobox)** and the
**[Download Trigger](/docs/components/download-trigger)**, along with quality
improvements to make building with Chakra even smoother.

## Combobox

The Combobox is a versatile input component that combines a text input with a
listbox, allowing users to filter a list of options and select single or
multiple values.

Comboboxes are deceptively tricky, you want keyboard support, screen reader
accessibility, filtering, controlled/uncontrolled behavior, and easy
customization. We built this so you don't have to wire all that up yourself.

### Basic Usage

The basic combobox provides a searchable dropdown with single selection.

<ExampleTabs name="combobox-basic" />

### Multi-Items Select

Pass the `multiple` prop to the `Combobox.Root` to enable multiple selection.
This allows users to select multiple items from the list.

<ExampleTabs name="combobox-with-multiple" />

## Download Trigger

The DownloadTrigger component makes it simple to trigger file downloads directly
from your UI. It comes in handy when you're offering downloadable reports,
exporting images, or triggering async-generated files.

### Basic Usage

Pass the data you want to download to the `data` prop, and specify the
`fileName` and `mimeType` of the file.

<ExampleTabs name="download-trigger-basic" />

### Promise

You can trigger downloads from a promise that returns a `Blob`, `File`, or
`string`.

<ExampleTabs name="download-trigger-with-promise" />

## Other Improvements

### System

- Fix issue where passing `d` prop to `chakra.path` adds it to styles not as a
  direct attribute.

- Fix issue where responsive semantic tokens did not get applied.

### Select

- Fix issue where indicator group doesn't align correctly in RTL layouts.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```
