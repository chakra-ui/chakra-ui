Chakra UI v3.31 is out, and the headliner is one of the most requested features
we've seen: a full **[Rich Text Editor](/docs/components/rich-text-editor)**
composition. We also shipped ActionBar placement variants, Slider anatomy
improvements, and a round of important bug fixes.

## Rich Text Editor

Building a rich text editor from scratch is hard. Wiring up toolbars, handling
keyboard shortcuts, managing extensions, and making it all look consistent with
your design system—that's a lot of work before you even get to the actual
content.

That's why we built a complete
[Rich Text Editor](/docs/components/rich-text-editor) composition on top of
[Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev). It ships as a composition rather than a built-in
primitive, which means you get full source code you can customize however you
need.

<ExampleTabs name="rich-text-editor-basic" />

### Controlled Mode

Sync the editor's HTML output with your app state. The `onUpdate` callback gives
you the current content whenever it changes—handy for forms, autosave, or
previewing output alongside the editor.

### Bubble Menu

A floating toolbar that appears when users select text. Great for quick
formatting without reaching for the main toolbar.

<ExampleTabs name="rich-text-editor-with-bubble-menu" />

### Mentions and Hashtags

Type `@` to trigger a mention picker or `#` for hashtags. The suggestion menus
are fully customizable and built with Chakra UI components.

Beyond what's shown above, the composition includes text formatting, headings,
font controls, text alignment, lists, image insertion, code blocks, emoji, drag
handles, mode switching, autosave, and more.

## ActionBar Placement

The ActionBar component now supports a `placement` variant so you can position
it at `bottom`, `bottom-start`, or `bottom-end`. There's also a new
`--action-bar-offset` CSS variable if you need finer control over the offset
from edges.

## Slider Improvements

- Added `markerLabel` to the component anatomy for theming marker labels
- New `Slider.MarkerLabel` component for custom marker label rendering
- Improved focus ring styles on `Slider.Thumb`

## Bug Fixes

- **ColorPicker, Select, Combobox**: Fixed z-index stacking when used inside
  dialogs
- **cva**: Normalized base styles to prevent shorthand properties from
  overwriting variant styles
- **Menu**: Fixed content background not rendering by using full token path for
  CSS variable
- **SkeletonText**: Fixed duplicating children when `loading` is set to `false`

## Upgrading

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

Everything in this release is backward compatible—no breaking changes or
migration needed. Just upgrade and start building.
