Building user interfaces with Chakra UI just got a lot easier! Today, we're
launching the Chakra UI MCP Server to connect your LLM directly with Chakra UI.

If you've ever found yourself switching between your editor and the Chakra UI
docs, looking for the right prop name, or trying to remember how to implement a
particular component, the MCP server is for you.

## What you get with the MCP Server

Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the Chakra MCP Server understands
your questions and gives you accurate answers. Here's what it does:

- Get a complete list of every Chakra UI component when you need it
- See what props each component accepts, their types, and default values
- Get ready-to-use code blocks to build your applications
- Customize design tokens, colors, and typography settings easily
- Migrate your existing code from version 2 to version 3

Check out the list of all the tools available.

## See it in action

The MCP Server integrates with various MCP Clients like GitHub Copilot, Claude,
Cursor and more. For example, if you need a pricing section for your app?
Instead of manually developing this yourself, figuring out semantic tokens and
responsiveness, simply describe what you need.

## Try it today

The Chakra UI MCP Server is available now and getting started takes about two
minutes.

Within your `mcp.json` file, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/react-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Check out our detailed [guides](docs/get-started/ai/mcp-server) on how to set it
up with various MCP clients.

The MCP ecosystem is growing fast, and we want to make sure the Chakra UI MCP
Server keeps getting better. We're always listening to developer feedback and
working on improvements that actually matter to your daily workflow.
