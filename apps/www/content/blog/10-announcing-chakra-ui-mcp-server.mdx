The days of juggling multiple browser tabs while coding are over. And if you're
migrating from Chakra UI v2 to v3, the days of wrestling with breaking changes
and outdated examples are finally behind you too.

Today, we're excited to introduce the **Chakra UI MCP Server** - a server that
provides a comprehensive knowledge base about Chakra UI v3 to AI agents.

## Chakra UI MCP Server

Whether you're using Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Claude Code, you can now get
instant answers about:

- component props and examples
- design tokens and theme customization
- migrating from v2 to v3
- building UIs with Chakra UI
- **[Coming Soon]** pre-made component blocks (requires a
  [Chakra Pro](https://pro.chakra-ui.com/) license)

## The new way of building

**Picture this:** You're working on a new feature in your product. You know
Chakra UI has components for what you need, but you can't remember whether the
component is called `Modal` or `Dialog` in v3 or even the prop to use.

Instead of checking through docs, just ask your AI agent natural questions:

- "What components can I use for navigation?"
- "Show me how to build a pricing card with proper dark mode support"
- "Help me convert this v2 Modal to the new v3 syntax"

<br />

Let's look at a few demos.

:::steps

### Asking about components

Using VSCode Copilot to ask about the props of a dialog component.

## Using the MCP Server

:::steps

### Configuring the MCP Server

Add this to your AI tool's configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chakra-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chakra-ui/react-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Start the MCP Server

In some IDEs (like VSCode), you might need to start the MCP server manually.
Click the "Start" button.

### Start Vibe coding! ðŸ˜Ž

That's it! Your AI assistant now has expert knowledge of:

âœ… **Access to Chakra UI components** and their props  
âœ… **Design patterns and best practices** for every use case  
âœ… **Theme customization** with semantic tokens  
âœ… **Migration strategies** for v2 to v3 upgrades

:::

## What's Coming Next

We're just getting started! Here's what's on the horizon:

ðŸš€ **Pro Blocks Integration**: Support for accessing our entire premium
component library to design even more beautiful apps

âš¡ **Recipe customization**: Support for customizing the default recipes in
Chakra UI.

ðŸŽ¨ **Custom Theming**: Support for custom design tokens.

## Conclusion

The Chakra UI MCP Server helps you ship apps faster with the help of AI agents.
Check out the **[MCP docs](/docs/get-started/ai/mcp-server)** to setup the
server in your favorite IDE.
