The days of juggling multiple browser tabs while coding are over. And if you're
migrating from Chakra UI v2 to v3, the days of wrestling with breaking changes
and outdated examples are finally behind you too.

Today, we're excited to introduce the **Chakra UI MCP Server** - a tool that
provides a comprehensive knowledge base about Chakra UI v3 and works directly
inside your favorite IDE.

[VIDEO DEMO: Quick 30-second overview showing the MCP server]

## Introducing Chakra MCP

Whether you're using Cursor, GitHub Copilot, or Claude Code, you can now get
instant answers about:

- component props and examples
- design tokens and theme customization
- migrating from v2 to v3
- building UIs with Chakra UI
- **[SOON]** pre-made component blocks (requires a
  [Chakra Pro](https://pro.chakra-ui.com/) license)

all without ever leaving your IDE.

## The new way of building

**Picture this:** You're working on a new feature in your product. You know
Chakra UI has components for what you need, but you can't remember whether the
component is called `Modal` or `Dialog` in v3 or even the prop to use.

Instead of checking through docs, just ask your AI agent natural questions:

- "What components can I use for navigation?"
- "Show me how to build a pricing card with proper dark mode support"
- "Help me convert this v2 Modal to the new v3 syntax"

Let's look at a few demos.

**Asking about components**

**Upgrading from v2 to v3**
