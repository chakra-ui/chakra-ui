We're excited to ship Chakra UI v3.30! This release brings you the highly
requested **[Splitter](/docs/components/splitter)** component—a powerful,
flexible way to build resizable panel interfaces that users can customize to
their workflow.

Alongside Splitter, we've polished the Carousel component with better
variable-width support, enhanced our semantic token system for more consistent
theming, and squashed bugs across the board.

## Splitter

Splitter gives you everything you need to build resizable panel interfaces.
Users can drag handles between panels to adjust layouts on the fly—perfect for
IDE layouts, customizable dashboards, or any interface where personalization
matters.

It handles all the complexity: horizontal and vertical orientations, multi-panel
configurations, controlled and uncontrolled modes, and even nested splitters for
sophisticated layouts. Just define your panels and let Splitter handle the rest.

### IDE Layout Example

Here's a real-world example: an IDE-style layout with resizable panels. This
shows how Splitter can transform a static layout into something users can
customize to their workflow.

<ExampleTabs name="splitter-ide-layout" />

### Controlled Splitter

Need to persist user preferences or implement custom resize logic? Use the
`onResize` and `size` props to take full control of panel sizing.

## Carousel Improvements

Carousel just got more flexible. The new `autoSize` prop lets you build
carousels with variable-width slides—no more wrestling with fixed dimensions.
Perfect for card-based layouts, product galleries, or any content where slides
vary in size.

We've also tightened up the interaction behavior:

- Fixed dragging after tab switches or scrolling
- Smoothed out mouse wheel scrolling with `allowMouseDrag`

## Enhanced Semantic Tokens

We've added a new `border` semantic token across all color palettes, giving
outline variants a more polished look. The token intelligently adapts to your
palette—`gray.300`/`gray.700` for gray palettes, `color.500`/`color.400` for
colored ones.

Button, Badge, Tag, and Checkbox now use this token for their outline variants,
delivering better visual consistency, especially when working with non-gray
color palettes.

> **Note**: Everything includes CSS variable fallbacks, so your existing themes
> keep working without any changes.

## Bug Fixes

We've addressed several important issues:

- **Combobox**: Fixed focus stealing in controlled mode and removed problematic
  `aria-hidden` behavior
- **HoverCard, Tooltip, Popover**: Fixed arrow direction in RTL layouts
- **TagsInput**: Fixed overflow issue where very long tags would overflow
  instead of truncating with ellipsis

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react@latest
```

Everything in this release is backward compatible—no breaking changes or
migration needed. Just upgrade and start building.
