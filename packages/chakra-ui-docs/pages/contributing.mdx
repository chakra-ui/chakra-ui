# Contributing to Chakra UI

Thanks for being interested in contributing! We're so glad you want to help!

We want contributing to Chakra UI to be enjoyable, and educational for anyone
and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including issues, new docs as well
as updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository
before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions
with the project.

## Getting started

Please create a new branch from an up to date master on your fork. (Note, urgent
hotfixes should be branched off the latest stable release rather than master)

- Fork the Chakra UI repository on Github
- Clone your fork to your local machine
  `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/chakra-ui.git`
- Create a branch `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
- Make your changes, lint, then push to to GitHub with
  `git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch`.
- Visit GitHub and make your pull request.

If you have an existing local repository, please update it before you start, to
minimise the chance of merge conflicts.

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Docs contribution

Chakra UI uses NextJS for its documentation website. Thank you in advance and
cheers for contributing to our documentation! We created a simple command to run
it.

```sh
npm run docs:dev
```

You can now access the documentation site locally. Changes to the docs will hot
reload the site.
