# Getting Started

Install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies.

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming
```

Create a theme object to include custom color, typography, and layout values.
Chakra UI comes with a default theme, so this step is optional.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  breakpoints: ["30em", "48em", "62em", "80em"],
  fonts: {
    heading: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif',
    body: "system-ui, sans-serif",
    mono: "Menlo, monospace",
  },
  fontSizes: {
    xs: "0.75rem",
    sm: "0.875rem",
    md: "1rem",
    lg: "1.125rem",
    xl: "1.25rem",
    "2xl": "1.5rem",
    "3xl": "1.875rem",
    "4xl": "2.25rem",
    "5xl": "3rem",
    "6xl": "4rem",
  },
};
```

You can also extend the theme to add your custom colors, fonts, etc.

```js
import { theme } from "chakra-ui";

// Let's say you want to add custom colors
const customTheme = {
  ...theme,
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    brand: {
      900: "#1a365d",
      800: "#153e75",
      700: "#2a69ac",
    },
  },
};
```

Add the theme to your application with the `ThemeProvider`, passing in the theme
object as a prop.

```jsx live=false
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "chakra-ui";

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from the chakra-ui package, as demonstrated
above.

```js
import { Button } from "chakra-ui";
```

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply global styles to your page. Here is how you can
do this with the utilities provided by Chakra UI.

## Adding Icons

You can use custom icons from standard libraries like [react-icons](#) or you
can add the icon paths into the theme object.

Here's how the icon aspect of the theme object looks.

```js
// Theme object
export default {
  icons: {
    search: {
      // This is can be the <path/> or <g> elements for the svg. Note the "fill=currentColor"
      path: (
        <path
          fill="currentColor"
          d="M23.384,21.619,16.855,15.09a9.284,9.284,0,1,0-1.768,1.768l6.529,6.529a1.266,1.266,0,0,0,1.768,0A1.251,1.251,0,0,0,23.384,21.619ZM2.75,9.5a6.75,6.75,0,1,1,6.75,6.75A6.758,6.758,0,0,1,2.75,9.5Z"
        />
      ),
      // This is the viewBox of the icon.
      viewBox: "0 0 24 24",
    },
  },
};
```

Once you add the icons, you can then use them within the `Icon` component, like
this;

```jsx live=true
<Icon name="search" color="red.500" />
```
