# Design Principles

Chakra UI is established on principles that make it more consistent throughout
its components. Understanding these concepts will help you to work with any
Chakra component right away.

Our goal is to design simple, composable yet beautiful components that cater to
real life UI design problems. In order to do that, we developed a set of
principles that help us always be on that path.

- **Separate Style from Functionality:** We decoupled most of the styling from
  the functionality to make it easy for you to create your own custom
  components.

- **Composition:** Break down components into smaller parts and compose them
  together. This helps to keep the styles and functionality flexible and
  extensible. Make the smaller components and composed component available to
  users.

- **Dark Mode:** Try to make components dark mode compatible. Use our
  ColorModeProvider, useDarkMode hook handle styling.

- **Accessible:** We keep accessibility top of mind for all components from
  keyboard, to color contrast to voice over. We intend to do more rigorous
  accessibility tests soon.

- **Hooks:** We feel in love with react hooks at first sight. Most of our
  components are composed with hooks and context. StyleHooks and FunctionHooks.

- **Limit the use of `styled()` or `css` prop:** All our components' styles can
  be overriden or extended via a style props. We prefer to compose new
  components from the base `Box` component, as much as possible we stay away
  from `styled()` or `css` prop as a means to pass styles to a component.
