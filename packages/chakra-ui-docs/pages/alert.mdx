# Alert

Alerts are used to communicate a state that affects a system, feature or page.
This component exports 4 Alert related components:

- **Alert**: The wrapper for alert components. It composes the `Flex` component.

- **AlertIcon**: The visual indicator for the alert. It composes the `Icon`
  component and changes the icon based on the `status` passed.

- **AlertTitle**: The title of the alert. It composes the `Box` component,
  meaning you can pass all `Box` props to this component

- **AlertDescription**: The description of the alert. It also composes the `Box`
  component.

## Usage

```jsx
<Alert status="error">
  <AlertIcon />
  <AlertTitle mr={2}>Your browser is outdated!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>Your Chakra experience may be degraded.</AlertDescription>
  <CloseButton position="absolute" right="8px" top="8px" />
</Alert>
```

## Status

Alerts can have different statuses, so we've added the `status` prop.

```jsx
<List spacing={3}>
  <Alert status="error">
    <AlertIcon />
    There was an error processes your request
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="success">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="warning">
    <AlertIcon />
    Seems your account is about expire, upgrade now
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="info">
    <AlertIcon />
    Chakra is going live on August 30th. Get ready!
  </Alert>
</List>
```

## Variant

Alerts come in different variant so you have enough options to pick from.

```jsx
<List spacing={3}>
  <Alert status="success" variant="subtle">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="success" variant="solid">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="success" variant="left-accent">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="success" variant="top-accent">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
</List>
```

## Alert with Stripes

In some cases, you might need to show a critical situation alert, say, when
there is an app-wide performance issue that affects a wide range of users or
deeply affects an individual's product usage. Combining the `solid` variant and
`hasStripe` can help you draw their attention.

```jsx
<Alert status="error" variant="solid" hasStripe>
  <AlertTitle mr={2}>We're having some trouble.</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Hang in there. We're working on fixing this now.
  </AlertDescription>
  <CloseButton position="absolute" right="8px" top="8px" />
</Alert>
```

## Composition

Alert ships with smaller component to allow for flexibility and make it easy to
create all kinds of layout.

```jsx
<Alert
  status="success"
  variant="subtle"
  flexDirection="column"
  justifyContent="center"
  textAlign="center"
  height="200px"
>
  <AlertIcon size="40px" mr={0} />
  <AlertTitle mt={4} mb={1} fontSize="lg">
    Application submitted!
  </AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription maxWidth="sm">
    Thanks for submitting your application. Our team will get back to you soon.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```
