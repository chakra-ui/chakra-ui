# Migration Notes

- We renamed `colorStart` and `colorEnd` to `startColor` and `endColor` to
  better consistency and intuitiveness

- Better theming support for Skeleton component.

- We renamed `duration` to `fadeDuration`

- Added `SkeletonText` component to make it easy to create simple paragraph
  skeletons.

- Added `SkeletonCircle` component to make it easy to create circular skeletons
  without having to type `borderRadius` everytime.
