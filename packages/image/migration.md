# Fixes

- Resolved the common SSR issue with Next.js

# Features

- Support for `fit` prop to specify how to fit an image within its dimension. It
  uses the `object-fit` property

- Support for `align` prop to specify how to align the image within its
  dimension. It uses the `object-position` property
