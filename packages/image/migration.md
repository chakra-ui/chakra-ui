# Fixes

- Resolved the common SSR issue with Next.js

# Features

- Support for `fit` prop to specify how to fit an image within it's dimension.
  It uses the `object-fit` property

- Support for `align` prop to specify how to align the image within it's
  dimension. It uses the `object-position` property

- Support for custom `fallback` component incase you don't want to use
  `fallbackSrc`

# TBD

- Support for fade-in or blur-in entrace animation for image?

- Support for Modern image formats?
