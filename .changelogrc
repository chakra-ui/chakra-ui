- `beforeLoadOrError` is the default strategy and previous behaviour of `Image`
  which displays/loads the placeholder when `loading` the `src`/`srcSet` and on
  `error`
- `onError` strategy displays/loads the fallback image only on `error`
- Bump all packages to next major for Chakra UI version 2.

**Alert** `v2.0.0`

  <MyCustomIcon />
</AlertIcon>
```

- Bump all packages to next major for Chakra UI version 2.

- Bump peer dependency to React and ReactDOM to >=18

**Storybook Addon** `v2.0.0`

- Fixed an issue where the storybook addon did not use the default theme if none
  was provided
- Bump all packages to next major for Chakra UI version 2.
- Omit `src` directory from being published to npm
- Bumped the supported version of storybook to >6.4 to support other bundlers than
  webpack.

Disable the new Storybook feature flag `emotionAlias` to prevent version
mismatch issues with emotion:

```js live=false
module.exports = {
  addons: ['@chakra-ui/storybook-addon'],
  features: {
    emotionAlias: false,
  },
};
```

The ColorMode Toggle moved to the Storybook toolbar together with a new layout
direction toggle (ltr/rtl).

A new helper function extracts the ArgTypes for a given Chakra UI component. You
can quickly preview all variants, sizes and colorSchemes of your components
which are present in your Chakra UI Theme.

```tsx
// button.stories.tsx
import { getThemingArgTypes } from '@chakra-ui/storybook-addon';
import { theme } from '<your-theme>';

export default {
  title: 'Components / Forms / Button',
  argTypes: getThemingArgTypes(theme, 'Button'),
};

interface StoryProps extends ThemingProps<'Button'> {}

export const Basic: StoryFn<StoryProps> = (props) => (
  <Button {...props}>Button</Button>
);
```

- Bump peer dependency to React and ReactDOM to >=18
- Replace the button on the corner with a toggle tool

**Toast** `v2.0.0`

- Removed dependency to @reach-ui/alert
- Bump all packages to next major for Chakra UI version 2.
- Omit `src` directory from being published to npm
- > Please note: There are **no breaking changes** to the hook `useToast`. There
  > are only breaking changes to `createStandaloneToast`.

### Breaking changes to `createStandaloneToast`

Chakra UI v1 rendered the toast container DOM element for you. In v2 you need to
render the `ToastContainer` in your application code. This allows you have only
one React root in your application.

#### @chakra-ui/react v1

```ts
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast';

const toast = createStandaloneToast();
toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' });
```

#### @chakra-ui/react v2

```tsx
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast';

const { ToastContainer, toast } = createStandaloneToast();

// render the ToastContainer in your React root
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
ReactDOM.createRoot(yourRootElement).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <ToastContainer />
  </>
);

toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' });
```

- Added support for custom icons in a toast:

```tsx
const toast = useToast();
return (
  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      toast({
        title: 'Message me',
        icon: 'ðŸ’¬',
      });
    }}
  >
    Show Toast with custom icon
  </Button>
);
```

- Added memoization to the toast function from `useToast`
- Bump peer dependency to React and ReactDOM to >=18

Allow user configure the storage key for the provider and script. We now export
a `createLocalStorageManager` and `createCookieStorageManager` functions.

```jsx
const manager = createLocalStorageManager('{storageKey}');

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider colorModeManager={manager}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}
```

Add better support for cookie storage to provide better SSG experience. To use
cookie script, you can set `type=cookie`.

> Pro tip: You can also configure the `storageKey` from script as well

```jsx
import { ColorModeScript } from '@chakra-ui/react';
function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
        <title>App</title>
      </Head>
      <Body>
        <ColorModeScript type="cookie" />
        <Main />
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```

Refactored color mode to behave consistently between provider and script. The
new precedence is as follows:

- Get the color mode value in the specified localStorage or cookie manager
- If value doesn't exist, use the `initialColorMode` value specified.
  - If the initial value is `system`, then we'll compute the color mode using
    `matchMedia`
  - Else, we use the initial value as is.
- If user specifies `useSystemColorMode: true`, then we'll subscribe to color
  mode changes from the operating system. It is no longer used to determine the
  initial color mode. To achieve that, please use `initialColorMode: "system"`

Removed `--chakra-ui-color-mode` CSS variable and use `data-theme` attribute on
the `html` element.

Added `color-scheme` to the `html` element to ensure native form-elements render
in the correct mode.
