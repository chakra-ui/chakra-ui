  installed from npm.

- Add cursor `pointer` to the radio container

**Slider** `v1.5.2`

- Fixed a bug where a thumb would not move in case of stacked thumbs

**Color Mode** `v1.3.2`

- Fixed flaky color-mode test
- Fixed issue where `DarkMode` and `LightMode` elements rerenders their children
  even if the child is memoized.

`<LightMode>` and `<DarkMode>` components are now memoized to prevent
unnecessary rendering of their child components.
