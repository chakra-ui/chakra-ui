**Theme Tools** `v1.2.1`

- Replace `tinycolor2` with `@ctrl/tinycolor` to get better tree-shaking
  benefits

**Theme** `v1.10.2`

- Replace `tinycolor2` with `@ctrl/tinycolor` to get better tree-shaking
  benefits

**Checkbox** `v1.5.7`

- Add state `data-*` attributes to the checkbox `container` to allow user style
  the `_checked`, `_invalid` and `_disabled` states

**Slider** `v1.3.0`

- Add `RTL` support by using the theme's direction ("ltr" or "rtl") to set the
  default `isReversed` property when the `orientation` is `horizontal`

**Modal** `v1.9.0`

- **Drawer:** Add support for RTL-aware placement values. You can now pass
  `start` and `end` values. The drawer will use `left/right` placement depending
  on the specified `theme.direction` value.
- **Drawer**: omit the `motionPreset` prop type since `Drawer` only implements
  the `Slide` transition, unlike `Modal` that allows you switch its motion
  preset.

**Image** `v1.0.20`

- Fix issue where onload doesn't get called when using srcset
- If the user doesn't provide a `fallbackSrc` or a `fallback` `ignoreFallback`
  is applied by default

**Anatomy** `v1.0.1`

- Add missing breadcrumb part
- Add container part to checkbox

**Popper** `v2.3.0`

- `usePopper` now accepts a `direction` prop so it can handle placement for RTL
  languages. Values such as `top-start`, `top-end`, `bottom-start` and
  `bottom-end` will be flipped depending on the theme's direction value.

In addition to the default `popper.js` placement, you can pass `start-start`,
`start-end`, `end-start` and `end-end`. This will resolve to the equivalent
`popper.js` placement as well.

**Cli** `v1.5.1`

- Fixed an issue where the CLI did not resolve custom tsconfig paths.

🚨 Please note that only the first alias target from the string array will be
resolved.

```json live=false
// tsconfig.json
{
  //...
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@alias/*": ["target/*"]
      //           ^-- only the first target will be resolved
    }
  }
}
```

**Avatar** `v1.2.10`

- Fix issue where avatar blinks during API call due to its fallback logic. You
  can disable the fallback logic by setting `ignoreFallback`, just like you can
  with the `Image` component

**Toast** `v1.3.0`

- Add support for RTL-aware `position` values. You can now use `top-start`,
  `top-end`, `bottom-start` and `bottom-end` values. The toast will flip
  depending on the `direction` provided in the theme.

**Provider** `v1.6.8`

- Resolve dependency issues caused by previous release
- Add `ChakraProviderProps` type what was removed in previous release

**Menu** `v1.7.4`

- Fix issue where keyboard navigation doesn't work when `MenuButton` isn't
  rendered. This is useful in scenarios where you want the menu to be triggered
  by a command or right-click.

**Button** `v1.4.3`

- Fix issue where composing `Button` with framer-motion's `motion` factory
  breaks animation/transition

**Select** `v1.1.15`

- The disabled state of the `SelectIcon` can be reflected by a disabled
  `FormControl` or by the `isDisabled`-flag of the `select` field
