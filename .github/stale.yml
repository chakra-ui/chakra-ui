  Hi!

  This issue was labeled "awaiting response" or "needs reproduction" by a Chakra
  team member. In order to reduce the number of stale issues we have, I'm in
  charge of closing issues with no response or reproduction after 1 month.

  Since it's been 1 month and we still haven't received a response or
  reproduction, I will close this issue in 5 days. This issue will remain open
  if a response or reproduction is received before then.
