# Contributing

If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thank you for helping us make this
project great and being a part of the Chakra UI community. Here are a few
guidelines that will help you along the way.

## Submitting a pull request

Chakra UI is a community project, so pull requests are always welcome, but,
before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss
it with the maintainers.

As with issues, please begin the title with [ComponentName].

## Getting Started

This project uses

- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multiple libs
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for a great development experience
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/) for a blazing fast website.

Before doing anything else, run these commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
cd chakra-ui
yarn install
yarn bootstrap
yarn build
```

## Root Repo Scripts:

```sh
yarn bootstrap    # bootstraps lerna so all dependencies get
                  # linked for cross-component development

yarn storybook        # starts storybook server

yarn docs:dev         # runs the documentation site locally

yarn core:build        # build the component library

yarn release      # publishes changed packages
```

### Running the documentation site

The documentation site is built with Next but we created a simple command to run
it.

```sh
npm run docs:dev
```

You can now access the documentation site [locally](http://localhost:3000).
Changes to the docs will hot reload the site.

### Building locally

To use the provided build scripts with yarn you have to install `npm@^10`.
Depending on the package you want to build just run `npm run core:build`.

### Coding style

TODO

### Testing

We use `@testing-library/react` for unit testing components
([docs](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)). Our tests
should be written in typescript because this will validate that the type
definitions are valid.

Tests should be placed in the folder with the component it is testing. Typical
components should have just a single `test.tsx` file but if more organization is
needed, you can put the tests into a directory called `tests` inside of the
component directory you are testing. For example, such files could be
`AlertDialog/tests/style.test.tsx` and `AlertDialog/tests/interactive.test.tsx`

- Basic component example: See the `Badge` component tests in
  [`packages/chakra-ui/src/Badge/test.tsx`](packages/chakra-ui/src/Badge/test.tsx)
- Interactive component example: See the `AlertDialog` component tests in
  [`packages/chakra-ui/src/AlertDialog/test.tsx`](packages/chakra-ui/src/AlertDialog/test.tsx)

_We strongly recommend including tests on all pull requests as we work to
improve code coverage._

## How do I add a new demo in the documentation?

TODO

#### Edit the page Markdown file.

The Markdown file is the source for the website documentation. So, whatever you
wrote there will be reflected on the website.

In this case, the file you need to edit is `packages/chakra-ui-docs/pages/`, and
I'm going to add a description about the component.

## How do I use my local distribution of chakra-ui in any project?

Sometimes it is good to test your changes in a real world scenario, in order to
do that you can install your local distribution of Chakra UI in any project with
[lerna link](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/link).

First, you have to build your local distribution of Chakra UI:

```shell
# From the root of the project
yarn build
```

Next, you link your local distribution of Chakra UI to any project you want to
try your changes:

```shell
# From the root folder of any project
lerna link
```

Now, every time you import from `@chakra-ui/core` in your project, it is going
to use your local distribution.
