Creating a new guide for Chakra UI takes four steps:

1. Create your guide file
2. Add frontmatter
3. Write your guide content
4. Open a pull request

# Create your guide file

Create a file in `website/guides` with a filename that briefly describes your
guide in [kebab case][kebab-case]. For example, the path to this guide (the one
you're reading) is `website/guides/how-to-create-a-guide.mdx`.

# Add frontmatter

In order for your guide to work correctly, you must create [a frontmatter
block][frontmatter] at the top of the file. The frontmatter block provides data
about your guide to our documentation system ([gatsby]) that is used to generate
your guide's listing on the main guides page.

Your frontmatter block should specify a `title`, a `description`, your GitHub
username (as `creator`), and (optionally) a `tags` array. Here's the frontmatter
block for this guide:

```yaml
---
title: How to Create a Guide
description: A guide for creating a Chakra UI guide
tags: ["meta"]
creator: with-heart
---

```

> The frontmatter block **must** include the opening and closing `---` lines.

# Write your guide content

Our guides are written using MDX. MDX is JSX in Markdown.

If you're new to Markdown or MDX, here are a few resources to help you get
started:

- [Markdown Cheatsheet][markdown-cheatsheet]
- [MDX][mdx]

You can also open the `.mdx` file for this guide or any other Chakra UI guide
for inspiration.

# Open a pull request

Once you've created your guide, the final step is to open a pull request to the
Chakra UI repository. You'll need to fork the Chakra repo, push your changes to
a branch on your fork, and then open a pull request from your fork to the Chakra
repo.

In your pull request description, please provide a brief overview of your guide.

If you're unfamiliar with how forks or pull requests work, check out [How To:
Fork a GitHub Repository & Submit a Pull Request][how-to-fork-and-pr] by Jake
Jarvis.

Additionally, you can find more information relating to forks and PRs in the
following documentation from the GitHub website:
