# Getting Started

**1. Install Chakra UI**

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/core

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/core
```

**2. Install the default theme**

Chakra has prepared a default theme for you that you can modify or extends. The
theme contains specifications for the fonts, font sizes, colors, etc.

To get the default theme, install the `@chakra-ui/theme` package.

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/theme

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/theme
```

**3. Add the provider**

For Chakra to work correctly, you need to setup the global provider and add
browser css reset.

At the root of your application, here's what you need do:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from "react"
// 1. import these components
import { ChakraProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core"

// 2. import the theme
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"

// 3. Use at the root of your app
function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <CSSReset />
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> - For Next.js, you need to set this up in `pages/_app.js`
> - For Gatsby, install the `gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui`. It does it automatically
>   for you.
> - For Create React App, you need to set this up in `index.js`

<br />

That's it, you're good to go!
