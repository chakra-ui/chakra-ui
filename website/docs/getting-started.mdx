  "Install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies. Create a theme object to include
  custom color, typography, and layout values. Chakra UI comes with a default
  theme, so this step is optional."

# Getting Started

1. Install Chakra UI

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/core @emotion/core
```

2. **Clone the default theme**: Chakra has prepared a default theme for you that
   you can modify or extends. The theme contains specifications for the fonts,
   font-sizes, colors, etc.

   To get the default theme, run this command:

   ```bash
   # clone the javascript theme
   npx chakra-cli init --theme

   # clone the typescript theme
   npx chakra-cli init --theme --ts
   ```

   This command will copy the chakra theme to your project in a `chakra/`
   directory. There you can update all the tokens to match your brand or design
   requirements.

   <br />

3. **Add the providers**: For Chakra to work correctly, you need to setup some
   global providers and add browser css reset. At the root of your application,
   here's what you need do:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from "react"
import { ChakraProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core"

// Use at the root of your app
function Example() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> - If you use Next.js, you need to set this up in `pages/_app.js`
> - If you use Gatsby, kindly install the `gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui`. It does it
>   automatically for you.
> - If you use Create React App, you need to set this up in `index.js`

<br />

4. **Consume the theme**: Assuming you have the default theme in your `chakra/`
   directory. Add the `theme` to the `ChakraProvider`.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from "react"
import { ChakraProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core"
import theme from "./chakra"

// Use at the root of your app
function Example() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <CSSReset />
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

That's it, you're good to go!
