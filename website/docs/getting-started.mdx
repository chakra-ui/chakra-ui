# Getting Started

Install Chakra UI and its peer dependencies.

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/core

#or

yarn add @chakra-ui/core
```

Create a theme object to include custom color, typography, and layout values.
Chakra UI comes with a default theme, so this step is optional.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  breakpoints: ["30em", "48em", "62em", "80em"],
  fonts: {
    heading: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif',
    body: "system-ui, sans-serif",
    mono: "Menlo, monospace",
  },
  fontSizes: {
    xs: "0.75rem",
    sm: "0.875rem",
    md: "1rem",
    lg: "1.125rem",
    xl: "1.25rem",
    "2xl": "1.5rem",
    "3xl": "1.875rem",
    "4xl": "2.25rem",
    "5xl": "3rem",
    "6xl": "4rem",
  },
}
```

You can also extend the theme to add your custom colors, fonts, etc.

```js
import { theme } from "@chakra-ui/core"

// Let's say you want to add custom colors
const customTheme = {
  ...theme,
  colors: {
    ...theme.colors,
    brand: {
      900: "#1a365d",
      800: "#153e75",
      700: "#2a69ac",
    },
  },
}
```

Add the theme to your application with the `ThemeProvider`, passing in the theme
object as a prop.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from "react"
import { ThemeProvider } from "@chakra-ui/core"

// Use at the root of your app
function AppRoot() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Using components

Simply import components by name from `@chakra-ui/core` package, as demonstrated
below.

```js
import { Button } from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

## Injecting global styles

Sometimes you may need to apply css reset styles to your application. Chakra UI
exports a `CSSReset` that'll remove browser default styles. It's heavily
inspired by
[Tailwind's preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@1.1.2/dist/base.css)

> 🚨 We highly recommend that you add the `CSSReset` at the root of your
> application to ensure all components work correctly.

```jsx live=false
// import customTheme from "./theme"

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <CSSReset />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

## Adding Icons

You can use custom icons from standard libraries like
[react-icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com) or you can add the icon `path` in
the theme object.

To add the icon to the theme object, add the `icons` key as shown below.

```js
// theme.js
export default {
  icons: {
    // Add Chakra's icons
    ...theme.icons,
    // Your custom icons
    search: {
      // The <path/> or <g> element for the svg. Note the use of  `fill=currentColor`
      path: (
        <path
          fill="currentColor"
          d="M23.384,21.619,16.855,15.09a9.284,9.284,0,1,0-1.768,1.768l6.529,6.529a1.266,1.266,0,0,0,1.768,0A1.251,1.251,0,0,0,23.384,21.619ZM2.75,9.5a6.75,6.75,0,1,1,6.75,6.75A6.758,6.758,0,0,1,2.75,9.5Z"
        />
      ),
      // This is the viewBox of the icon.
      viewBox: "0 0 24 24",
    },
  },
}
```

Once you add the icons, you can then use them within the `Icon` component, like
this;

```jsx live=true
<SearchIcon color="red.500" />
```
