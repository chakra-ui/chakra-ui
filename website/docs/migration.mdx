# Upgrading from v0.x to v1.0

A simple guide to upgrade your existing Chakra UI projects to v1.0.

Chakra UI v1.0 is focused on improving the ideas and concepts from 0.x to make
even easier to create, theme and extend components.

While there's quite a number of new exciting features we've added, we focused on
making Chakra UI a stable base to build your own design systems on, so that you
can feel more confident using Chakra UI in production.

## Highlights

**Theming API:** Chakra UI now provides a new theming API which makes it easy to
style components and their modifiers (sizes, variants, and color scheme) from
your theme or locally using a `chakra` factory function.

**Color mode improvement:** We've fixed the bugs related to Color mode and it's
now easy to persist color mode, set initial color mode, and lock specific
components to a certain color mode.

**Better TypeScript support:** This means all components have very good
TypeScript support and most low-level components like Box, Flex, etc. will
support the `as` prop and types will be extracted properly.

**Theme-aware css prop:** Just like `theme-ui`, we've added a `sx` prop you can
use to add theme-aware styles.

**Deprecated PseudoBox:** We've removed PseudoBox and merged all it's props with
`Box` so you can use pseudo style props in all components.

**Strict Breakpoints:** We've constrained the breakpoint specified in
`theme.breakpoints` to be an object. The breakpoint keys must have one or more
of the following keys: `base`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.

> We've updated the default theme to include this changes.

## Upgrade steps

Here's a list of steps to take in order to migrate your project safely. Don't
worry if your styles aren't exactly the same—this is to be expected.

### 1. Update your dependencies

Chakra no longer requires `@emotion/core`, `@emotion/styled` and
`emotion-theming`. If you're not using these libraries in your code, you can
safely remove them and update Chakra UI to v1.

> We use only `@emotion/core` internally.

```diff
"dependencies": {
  "@chakra-ui/core": "next",
-  "@emotion/styled": "10.X",
-  "@emotion/theming": "10.x",
-  "@emotion/core": "10.x"
}
```

#### Installing specific components

Let's say you only use the button from Chakra UI, instead of installing
`@chakra-ui/core`, which installs all components, you can simply install
`@chakra-ui/button`.

For this approach, you'll also need to to install `@chakra-ui/system` which is
the backbone for all components.

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/button @chakra-ui/system

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/button @chakra-ui/system
```

#### Notes on Icons

Chakra moved all icons to a separate package `@chakra-ui/icons`. We recommend
using `react-icons` in your projects considering it has a robust set of icons.
However, you can still install this package.

#### Usage with TypeScript

Please note that when adding Chakra UI to a TypeScript project, a minimum
TypeScript version of `3.8.0` is required.

If you're adding Chakra UI to a `create-react-app` project, this means you'll
need to manually upgrade `typescript` from `~3.7.2` to `~3.8.0`. See
[the guide for our official `create-react-app`](../guides/cra-templates)
templates if you'd like to generate a Chakra-enabled `create-react-app` project
from scratch.

### 2. Adding the default theme

Chakra no longer comes with the default theme pre-installed, so you'll need to
add it manually. There are two ways to get the theme:

**From NPM:** This is the recommended way to install the theme. Install the
`@chakra-ui/theme` package.

```sh
npm i @chakra-ui/theme@next

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/theme@next
```

2. Update the `ThemeProvider` in your app's root by passing the `theme` prop.

```jsx live=false
import { ThemeProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core"
import theme from "./chakra"

function AppRoot() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CSSReset />
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

### 3. Update the ThemeProvider

Swap out `ThemeProvider` with `ChakraProvider` to make setup cleaner.
`ChakraProvider` adds the following providers for you automatically:

- **ThemeProvider:** Provides the theming context for all components
- **ColorModeProvider:** Provides color mode (light or dark) context to all
  components
- **PortalManager:** Manages portals and nested portals without using `z-index`
  in your application.
- **GlobalStyle**: Provides the global styles defined in `theme.styles.global`
  to your application.

```diff
-  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
+    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <CSSReset />
      <App />
+    </ChakraProvider>
-  </ThemeProvider>
```

### 4. Rename variantColor to colorScheme

Fire up your "Find and Replace" tool in VSCode or IntelliJ. Find `variantColor`
and replace with `colorScheme`.

> **Reason:** We named this prop to make it easier to understand that this prop
> represents a visual color scheme, not a css color attribute.

### 5. Update layout `size` prop

Change `size` prop to `width` or `w` and `height`, or `h`. If you'd like to use
only one prop to manage this, you can rename it to `boxSize`.

```diff
- <Box size="40px" />
+ <Box w="40px" h="40px" />
# or
+ <Box boxSize="40px" />
```

**We strongly recommend using the `width` and `height` props**

> **Reason:** We think the `size` prop should only be used for component size
> modifiers. The `size` prop has caused a lot of confusion in the past because,
> in some components (e.g. Button), it means the visual size and in others (e.g
> Box), it means **width and height**.

### 5. Update these prop names

These style props still work but **we recommend renaming them** to the new prop.
We now show a console warning when you use any of these deprecated props.

| Deprecated Prop    | New Prop                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| rounded            | borderRadius            |
| roundedLeft        | borderLeftRadius        |
| roundedRight       | borderRightRadius       |
| roundedTop         | borderTopRadius         |
| roundedTopLeft     | borderTopLeftRadius     |
| roundedTopRight    | borderTopRightRadius    |
| roundedBottomLeft  | borderBottomLeftRadius  |
| roundedBottomRight | borderBottomRightRadius |
| roundedBottom      | borderBottomRadius      |
| bgImg              | bgImage                 |
| bgPos              | bgPosition              |
| shadow             | boxShadow               |
| listStyleImg       | listStyleImage          |
| listStylePos       | listStylePosition       |

## Component Updates

We've updated the API of some components to fix bugs and improve usability,
types and accessibility.

- All components now take the pseudo style props (`_hover`, `_active`, etc.)
- Improved TypeScript support for the `as` prop

### Accordion

Can install as a stand-alone package: `@chakra-ui/accordion`

#### Changes

- Update all imports of `AccordionHeader` to `AccordionButton`. This is to
  remove the notion that it's a header when it's actually a `button`.

```diff
- import { AccordionHeader } from "@chakra-ui/core"
+ import { AccordionButton } from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

WAI-ARIA guidelines require that accordion buttons be wrapped in the appropriate
heading tag `h2-h6` based on the page heading flow.

We think the name `AccordionHeader` might mislead users to think we handle this
out of the box when we don't. Here's how to handle this:

```jsx live=false
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <h3>
      <AccordionButton>This is the button</AccordionButton>
    </h3>
    <AccordionPanel>This is the content</AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

- You can no longer use `AccordionItem` in isolation—it must be used within
  `Accordion`. We think most users don't do this by default but it's worth
  noting.

#### Features

**Keyboard Navigation:** `Accordion` now supports keyboard navigation between
accordion buttons. Pressing the `up` and `down` arrow keys will move focus
between accordion buttons.

### AspectRatioBox

- Change all imports of `AspectRatioBox` to `AspectRatio`

```diff
- import { AspectRatioBox } from "@chakra-ui/core"
+ import  { AspectRatio } from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

### Avatar

#### Features

- You can now use a custom fallback avatar icon by passing the `icon` prop:

```jsx live=false
<Avatar src="john.png" name="John Doe" icon={<UserIcon />} />
```

- You can now change the `borderRadius` of the avatar

- Theming Support: All design decisions for the Avatar are located in
  `chakra/components/Avatar` in your cloned theme, which means you can customize
  the styles to suit your brand needs.

- Added `getInitials` prop to allow users to manage how initials are generated
  from name. By default we merge the first characters of each word in the `name`
  prop.

### Breadcrumb

- Removed support for the `addSeparator` prop

### Button

#### Changes

- We've unified the usage of all icon props to only accept a React element.
  Update all icon names used in `leftIcon` or `rightIcon` to the equivalent icon
  React element.

  > Replacement logic: If `leftIcon` is `email`, then replace it with
  > `<EmailIcon/>` from Chakra.

```diff
import { PhoneIcon } from "@chakra-ui/core"

- <Button leftIcon="phone">Call</Button>
+ <Button leftIcon={<PhoneIcon />}>Call</Button>
```

**This reduces the effort needed to use custom icons, eliminates TypeScript
errors, and reduces unused icons bloating your app.**

- Renamed `variantColor` to `colorScheme`

- Removed negative side margins on `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` elements. We
  believe the user should handle these side margins.
  [#1024](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/1024)

#### Features

- Added support for custom spinners using the `spinner` prop

```jsx live=false
import { BeatLoader } from "react-spinners"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Button isLoading colorScheme="blue" spinner={<BeatLoader color="white" />}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### Checkbox

#### Changes

- Change `variantColor` to `colorScheme`

```diff
- <Checkbox variantColor="blue">Option</Checkbox>
+ <Checkbox colorScheme="blue">Option</Checkbox>
```

- Deprecated the `isFullWidth` prop. `Checkbox` now takes up the width of the
  parent by default.

- To allow for better checkbox group layout, the `CheckboxGroup` component no
  longer supports every style prop. You can now only pass `size`, `variant`, and
  `colorScheme` in addition to `CheckboxGroup`-specific props (`value`,
  `defaultValue`, and `onChange`).

```jsx live=false
// before
<CheckboxGroup isInline spacing="40px" defaultValue={["one", "two"]}>
  <Checkbox value="one">One</Checkbox>
  <Checkbox value="two">Two</Checkbox>
  <Checkbox value="three">Three</Checkbox>
</CheckboxGroup>

// after
<CheckboxGroup defaultValue={["one", "two"]}>
  <Stack spacing="40px">
    <Checkbox value="one">One</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox value="two">Two</Checkbox>
    <Checkbox value="three">Three</Checkbox>
  </Stack>
</CheckboxGroup>
```

> We believe a checkbox group's layout should be managed by your design
> requirements. The checkboxes can be grouped using `Stack`, placed in a grid
> using `SimpleGrid` or made to wrap automatically using `Wrap`.

#### Features

- Added the `iconColor` and `iconSize` props to customize the default check icon

```jsx live=false
<Checkbox iconColor="blue" iconSize="1rem">
  Option
</Checkbox>
```

- Added the `spacing` prop to customize the spacing between the checkbox and
  label text

```jsx live=false
<Checkbox spacing="1rem">Option</Checkbox>
```

- The `useCheckbox` hook is exported with state and focus management logic for
  use in creating tailor-made checkbox component for your application

- The `useCheckboxGroup` hook is exported with state management logic for use in
  creating tailor-made checkbox group component for your application

### ColorMode

- You can now set the initial color mode you want your application to start
  with. Set `theme.config.initialColorMode` to `light` or `dark`

  ```jsx live=false
  const theme = {
    config: {
      initialColorMode: "dark",
    },
  }
  ```

- You can now update the color mode based on your user's device preference. Set
  `theme.config.useSystemColorMode` to `true` or `false`

  ```jsx live=false
  const theme = {
    config: {
      useSystemColorMode: true,
    },
  }
  ```

#### Bug Fix

- Color mode now persists correctly when you refresh the page. All you need to
  do is add `InitializeColorMode` script as the first child of `body`.

  Here's how to add it for Next.js:

```jsx live=false
// pages/_app.js
import { InitializeColorMode } from "@chakra-ui/core"

export default class Document extends NextDocument {
  static async getInitialProps(ctx) {
    const initialProps = await NextDocument.getInitialProps(ctx)
    return { ...initialProps }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          {/* 👇 Here's the script */}
          <InitializeColorMode />
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
}
```

Here's how to add it for Gatsby:

```jsx live=false
// gatsby-ssr.js
export const onRenderBody = ({ setPreBodyComponents }) => {
  setPreBodyComponents([<InitializeColorMode key="chakra-ui-no-flash" />])
}
```

You can also install the
[`gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui)
package which automatically configures `InitializeColorMode` along with
`ChakraProvider`.

### Editable

#### Changes

- The `onRequestEdit` prop has been renamed to `onEdit`. This applies to both
  the prop passed to `Editable` as well as the prop in its render props.

### FormControl

- We've improved the accessibility of the `FormControl` component. Here are the
  changes:

  - `id` passed to the form control will be passed to the form input directly
  - `FormLabel` will have `htmlFor` that points to the `id` of the form input
  - `FormErrorMessage` adds `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` pointing to
    the form input
  - `FormHelperText` adds/extends `aria-describedby` pointing to the form input
  - `isDisabled`, `isRequired`, `isReadOnly` props passed to `FormControl` will
    cascade across all related components

- `FormLabel` is now aware of the `disabled`, `focused` and `error` state of the
  form input. This helps you style the label accordingly using the `_disabled`,
  `_focus`, and `_invalid` style props.

- If you render `FormErrorMessage` and `isInvalid` is `false` or `undefined`,
  `FormErrorMessage` won't be visible. The only way to make it visible is by
  passing `isInvalid` and setting it to `true`.

### Icons

#### Changes

- Basic interface icons provided by Chakra have moved to the `icons` package.
  Replace all `<Icon name="..." />` elements imported from `core` with
  equivalent _named_ icon React elements imported from `icons`.

  > Replacement logic: If `<Icon name="search" />` is used, then replace it with
  > `<SearchIcon />` from Chakra icons package.

```diff
- import { Icon } from "@chakra-ui/core"
- <Icon name="search" />
+ import { SearchIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons"
+ <SearchIcon />
```

Existing icons will appear as a question mark until refactored.

- We changed the way custom icons are created. Instead of adding custom icons to
  `theme` create your own icons using the `createIcon` utility:

```jsx live=false
import { createIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icon"
export const UpDownIcon = createIcon({
  displayName: "UpDownIcon",
  viewBox: "-1 -1 9 11",
  d:
    "M 3.5 0L 3.98809 -0.569442L 3.5 -0.987808L 3.01191 -0.569442L 3.5 0ZM 3.5 9L 3.01191 9.56944L 3.5 9.98781L 3.98809 9.56944L 3.5 9ZM 0.488094 3.56944L 3.98809 0.569442L 3.01191 -0.569442L -0.488094 2.43056L 0.488094 3.56944ZM 3.01191 0.569442L 6.51191 3.56944L 7.48809 2.43056L 3.98809 -0.569442L 3.01191 0.569442ZM -0.488094 6.56944L 3.01191 9.56944L 3.98809 8.43056L 0.488094 5.43056L -0.488094 6.56944ZM 3.98809 9.56944L 7.48809 6.56944L 6.51191 5.43056L 3.01191 8.43056L 3.98809 9.56944Z",
})
```

As a convenience you can also import `createIcon` from the `icons` package along
with other icons:

```jsx live=false
import { createIcon, MoonIcon, SunIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons"
```

### Skeleton

#### Features

- Added `SkeletonText` component to add paragraph skeletons.
- Added `SkeletonCircle` component to add avatar or circular skeletons.

#### Changes

We've renamed the props from `colorStart` and `colorEnd` to `startColor` and
`endColor`.

### Image

#### Bug Fixes

- Resolved the common SSR issue with Next.js

#### Features

- Added support for the `fit` prop to specify how to fit an image within its
  dimension. It uses the `object-fit` property

- Added support for the `align` prop to specify how to align the image within
  its dimension. It uses the `object-position` property

- Added support for custom `fallback` component

### Input

- When using `InputAddon`, you no longer need to pass border radius properties
  to the `Input`. `InputGroup` will intelligently detect the addon and apply the
  necessary border to the input.

- Input now uses `paddingY` instead of `height` for its block height.

### Link

- Due to accessibility reasons, we've deprecated the `isDisabled` prop for
  `Link`.

### Stack

- To reduce the API surface area, we've deprecated the `isInline` and
  `isReversed` props in favor of the `direction` prop

```diff
- <Stack isInline>
+ <Stack direction="row">
    <Box />
    <Box />
  </Stack>
```

- We've deprecated the `shouldWrapChildren` prop because we now use css to
  manage the stack rather than `React.cloneElement`

- Added support for responsive `direction` and `spacing` props

```jsx live=false
<Stack direction={["column", "row"]}>
  <Box />
  <Box />
</Stack>
```

- Added support for `divider` prop between stacked element. Dividers also work
  with responsive direction and spacing.

```jsx live=false
<Stack divider={<StackDivider />}>
  <Box />
  <Box />
</Stack>
```

- You can also use the `HStack` and `VStack` components to conveniently stack
  elements in the horizontal or vertical directions respectively.

### Menu

#### Changes

- All popper related props that used to be passed to `MenuList` component,
  should now be passed to `Menu`. Reason: To support nested menus
- `placement` prop has moved from `MenuList` to `Menu`

#### Features

- Added support for menu icons and commands (or hotkeys)

```jsx live=false
<Menu>
  <MenuButton size="sm" colorScheme="teal">
    Open menu
  </MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem command="⌘T">New Tab</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem command="⌘N">New Window</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem command="⌘⇧N">Open Closed Tab</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem command="⌘O">Open File...</MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```

- Support for menu transitions and animations

  > It's important to use the `css` or `sx` prop for the transitions to work
  > properly. For some reason, it doesn't work with the `style` native prop

```jsx live=false
<Menu>
  <MenuButton size="sm" colorScheme="teal">
    Open menu
  </MenuButton>
  <MenuTransition>
    {(styles) => (
      <MenuList css={styles}>
        <MenuItem command="⌘T">New Tab</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem command="⌘N">New Window</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem command="⌘⇧N">Open Closed Tab</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem command="⌘O">Open File...</MenuItem>
      </MenuList>
    )}
  </MenuTransition>
</Menu>
```

- Added support for Portals. Wrap the `MenuList` in the `Portal` component and
  you're good to go!

```jsx live=false
<Menu>
  <MenuButton size="sm" colorScheme="teal">
    Open menu
  </MenuButton>
  <Portal>
    <MenuList>
      <MenuItem>Menu 1</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>New Window</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Open Closed Tab</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Open File</MenuItem>
    </MenuList>
  </Portal>
</Menu>
```

- Moved to Popper V2 🥳

### Fixes

- Fixed issue with `as` prop for `MenuItem`
- Fixed issue with `Link` not navigating to the specified `href` value
- Fixed issue where menu popper gets cut off when component is far right
- Fixed issue where `Menu` throws if no `MenuItem` exist
- Fixed issue where `closeOnSelect` doesn't work on navigation when using
  `MenuItem` as link

### Modal

#### Changes

- Removed `addAriaLabels` and `formatIds` props in favor of passing a top-level
  `id` prop to the modal, and we'll handle the rest.

- Removed `preserveScrollBarGap` prop. We preserve scroll bar gap by default to
  prevent any layout shift.

- Wrap `ModalContent` with the `ModalOverlay` component.

```diff
// before
<Modal>
-  <ModalOverlay />
  <ModalContent>
    <ModalHeader>Modal header</ModalHeader>
    <ModalCloseButton />
    <ModalBody>Modal body</ModalBody>
    <ModalFooter>Modal footer</ModalFooter>
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>

// after
<Modal>
+  <ModalOverlay>
    <ModalContent>
      <ModalHeader>Modal header</ModalHeader>
      <ModalCloseButton />
      <ModalBody>Modal body</ModalBody>
      <ModalFooter>Modal footer</ModalFooter>
    </ModalContent>
+  </ModalOverlay>
</Modal>
```

- Only pass `size` values defined in the components theme. Hard-coded values
  will be ignored. Update the styles in `theme.components.Modal` to reflect your
  custom values

- You can now disable focus trap by passing `trapFocus={false}`

- The `SlideIn` and `Scale` transition components have been replaced with the
  `Fade`, `ScaleFade`, `Slide`, and `SlideFade` components.

#### New Props

- `trapFocus`: to disable focus trap
- `autoFocus`: to disable autofocus on the first interactive element
- `onOverlayClick`: callback fired when the overlay is clicked
- `onEsc`: callback fired when `esc` is pressed

### NumberInput

- Added example where consumers can format and parse number input values (
  [#438](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/438))

- Fixed issue where error is thrown if the input value is greater than the `max`
  prop when focus is blurred (
  [#584](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/584))

- Fixed issue where deleting sole digit sets value to 0 (which may be invalid) (
  [#533](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/533))

- Fixed issue where input returns `NaN` value after multiple dots (
  [#364](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/364))

- Fixed issue where passing `id` to `NumberInput` and adding a `label` with
  `htmlFor` that points to that `id` doesn't focus the input (
  [#515](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/515))

### Progress

- Change `color` prop to `colorScheme`.

```diff
- <Progress color="blue"/>
+ <Progress colorScheme="blue"/>
```

- Added Support for `isIndeterminate` prop in the `Progress` component

### CircularProgress

- `trackColor` prop now takes a specific theme color or a valid `css` color.
- Change the `thickness` prop to point to an actual thickness value in `px`
  (e.g. `thickness={4}`)

### Radio

- Change `variantColor` prop to `colorScheme`.

```diff
- <Radio variantColor="blue">Option</Radio>
+ <Radio colorScheme="blue">Option</Radio>
```

- Deprecated the `isFullWidth` prop. The `Radio` takes up the width of the
  parent by default.

- Deprecated `RadioButton` component. Use the `useRadio` hook to create custom
  radio buttons.

- The `useRadio` hook is exported with state and focus management logic for use
  in creating tailor-made radio component for your application

### RadioGroup

- Deprecated the `isFullWidth` prop. The `RadioGroup` takes up the width of the
  parent by default.

- To allow for better Radio group layout, the `RadioGroup` component no longer
  supports every style prop. You can only pass `size`, `variant`, and
  `colorScheme` in addition to `RadioGroup` props (`value`, `defaultValue`, and
  `onChange`).

```jsx live=false
// before
<RadioGroup isInline defaultValue="one">
  <Radio value="one">One</Radio>
  <Radio value="two">Two</Radio>
  <Radio value="three">Three</Radio>
</RadioGroup>

// after
<RadioGroup defaultValue="one">
  <Stack direction="row">
    <Radio value="one">One</Radio>
    <Radio value="two">Two</Radio>
    <Radio value="three">Three</Radio>
  </Stack>
</RadioGroup>
```

## Slider

- Update JSX structure: Wrap `SliderFilledTrack` with `SliderTrack`.

```diff
// before
<Slider defaultValue={30}>
-  <SliderTrack />
-  <SliderFilledTrack />
  <SliderThumb />
</Slider>

// after
<Slider defaultValue={30}>
+  <SliderTrack>
+    <SliderFilledTrack />
+  </SliderTrack>
  <SliderThumb />
</Slider>
```

- Added support for the `isReversed` prop, which allows users to reverse the
  direction and functionality of the slider. This is mostly useful for `rtl`
  purposes.

- Added support for the `onChangeEnd` prop. Dragging the slider can trigger lots
  of updates and user might only be interested in the final result after sliding
  is complete.

- Added `isReadOnly` prop to support cases where slider needs to be in read-only
  state.

- Export the `useSlider` hook to help users manage and build custom slider UIs.

### Popover

- `returnFocusOnClose` has been changed to `returnFocus` for conciseness.

- `autoFocus` prop to allow users to control whether the popover should
  automatically receive focus when it opens.

### Stat

- We improved the semantic HTML structure of the Stat components to use `dl`,
  `dd`, and `dt` tags.

### Switch

- Rename the `color` prop to `colorScheme`

```diff
-  <Switch color="blue"/>
+  <Switch colorScheme="blue"/>
```

### Tabs

- Change `variantColor` prop to `colorScheme`

### Tags

- Change `variantColor` to `colorScheme`

```diff
- <Tag variantColor="blue"/>
+ <Tag colorScheme="blue"/>
```

- Added support for `isDisabled` prop on the `TagCloseButton` component

```jsx live=false
<Tag variant="solid" size="sm" colorScheme="cyan">
  <TagLabel>Tab Label</TagLabel>
  <TagCloseButton isDisabled />
</Tag>
```

### Toast

- Removed `react-spring` dependency in favor of `react-transition-group`
- Added support for duplicate toast prevention using `toast.isActive` method
- Added support to programmatically close one or all toasts using `toast.close`
  or `toast.closeAll` methods
- Added support to programmatically update a toast using `toast.update` method.
- Added support for `onCloseComplete` prop, a callback function to run side
  effects after the toast component has closed.

### Tooltip

- Added support for `closeOnMouseDown` prop

### CSS Reset

- Deprecated support for `config` prop, in favor of reading global styles from
  `theme.styles.global`
- Added global style for `focus-visible` in event you need to remove focus
  styles for non-keyboard interactions.

```sh
# as a dependency
yarn add focus-visible

# at the root of your application
import "focus-visible/dist/focus-visible"
```
