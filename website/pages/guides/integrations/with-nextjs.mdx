Chakra UI is a great UI library to get your Next.js website up and running fast
and accessibly. The setup is slightly different than other projects, however the
API usage seen in the rest of the docs is the same!

**The way to setup Chakra with Next.js shown in this Guide:**

- [From scratch](#chakra-providers)

## Chakra UI v1.0

With Chakra v1.0 being released there is couple of changes, you do not need to
install @emotion/core just chakra and its co-libraries like theme & icons if you
want to use the defaults can be done with the following command:

```zsh
npm i @chakra-ui/core @chakra-ui/theme @chakra-ui/icons

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/core @chakra-ui/theme @chakra-ui/icons
```

After installation, you'll need to add Chakra providers

## Chakra providers

Chakra exposes some context providers to give your website context of the theme,
and color mode.

In Next, inside the pages folder of your project is `_app.js`

```js live=false
import { ChakraProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core";
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <CSSReset />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```


### v0.8 and below

If you're still working on v0.8, the providers will be a bit different as seen
below.

install emotion and its co-libraries

```zsh
npm i @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-theming

# or

yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled emotion-themings
```

```jsx live=false
import { ThemeProvider, CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/core";
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <CSSReset />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```
