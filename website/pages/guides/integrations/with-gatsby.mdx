Chakra UI is a great UI library to get your [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) website up and running fast.
The setup is slightly different than other projects, however the
API usage seen in the rest of the docs is the same!

## Installation

Gatsby plugins make external APIs plug-and-play into your website. Installing
can be done with the following command:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion

# or

yarn add @chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

## Usage

After installation, you'll need to add `@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin` to the
`gatsby-config.js` file.

```jsx live=false
// gatsby-config.js

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin",
      options: {
        /**
         * @property {boolean} [resetCSS=true]
         * if false, this plugin will not use `<CSSReset />
         */
        resetCSS: true,
        /**
         * @property {boolean} [isUsingColorMode=true]
         * if false, this plugin will not use <ColorModeProvider />
         */
        isUsingColorMode: true,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

To use a custom theme, you can [shadow](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) this pluginâ€™s `theme.js` file
with your own theme:

```jsx live=false
// src/@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin/theme.js
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "rebeccapurple"
  }
}

export default extendTheme(theme)
```

If you want to use the [default theme](/docs/theming/theme) there's no need to shadow the file.

## Migration Notes

### From v1.x to v2.x

- The `isUsingColorMode` option was removed. The `ChakraProvider` will always use the `ColorModeProvider`
- The `isResettingCSS` option was renamed to `resetCSS`

### From v0.8.x to v1.x

- The Gatsby plugin has been renamed from `gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui` to
  `@chakra-ui/gatsby-plugin`. Please make sure to have updated this when
  installing Chakra UI in your next Gatsby project.
