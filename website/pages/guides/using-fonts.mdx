Fonts can be loaded into your project either by using NPM or by using the
`Global` component from the `@emotion/react` package.

## Option 1: Install with NPM

[Fontsource](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource) is an updating monorepo
full of self-hostable fonts bundled into individual NPM packages. It currently
supports all Google Fonts and a small subset of other custom Open Source fonts
that have been manually added.

Hosting your own fonts locally within a project can lead to large performance
gains as they won't experience extra (render blocking) network requests, as well
as streamlining developer experiences.

For the purposes of this guide, we'll use
[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) for the heading font
and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) for the body font. If
you have a different font you want to use, you can find the corresponding
package on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=fontsource) or their
[website](https://fontsource.org/).

Install the relevant fonts you wish to install using your package manager of
choice:

```bash
npm install @fontsource/open-sans @fontsource/raleway
```

Assign these fonts to `theme.fonts` to use them with Chakra. More details on
theming [here](/docs/theming/customize-theme).

```jsx live=false
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const theme = extendTheme({
  fonts: {
    heading: "Open Sans",
    body: "Raleway",
  },
})

export default theme
```

Then import the relevant font weights and styles into the same root file you
import `ChakraProvider` into.

```jsx live=false
import "@fontsource/raleway/400.css"
import "@fontsource/open-sans/700.css"

import {
  ChakraProvider,
  Container,
  Stack,
  Heading,
  Text,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
import theme from "./theme"

const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
    <Container>
      <Stack>
        <Heading>The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</Heading>
        <Text>
          Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the
          sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same
          illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the
          spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and
          the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose
          upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf
          below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the
          clouds.
        </Text>
      </Stack>
    </Container>
  </ChakraProvider>
)
```

> - For Create React App, you need to set this up in `index.js` or in Next.js,
>   this can be found in `_app.js`.

## Option 2: Using `@font-face`

Alternatively, custom fonts can be loaded in your Chakra project using the
`Global` component from the `@emotion/react` package and `@font-face` css rules.
You can then add these fonts to `theme.fonts` to make use of them throughout the
Chakra system.

First, we'll import all our relevant font files into the `public` or `static`
directory of your project, where the files will persist in location. Please note
that these persisting folders can vary per bundler or framework and should be
double-checked. This can later be used for the `url` selector for the
`@font-face` CSS rules.

Next, we'll define a `Fonts` component that sets up the `@font-face` rules in
the `styles` prop of `Global`:

```jsx live=false
import { Global } from "@emotion/react"

const Fonts = () => (
  <Global
    styles={`
      /* latin */
      @font-face {
        font-family: 'Heading Font Name';
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: 700;
        font-display: swap;
        src: url('./fonts/headingfont.woff2') format('woff2'), url('./fonts/headingfont.woff') format('woff');
        unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
      }
      /* latin */
      @font-face {
        font-family: 'Body Font Name';
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: 400;
        font-display: swap;
        src: url('./fonts/bodyfont.woff2') format('woff2'), url('./fonts/bodyfont.woff') format('woff');
        unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
      }
      `}
  />
)

export default Fonts
```

Assign these fonts to `theme.fonts` to use them with Chakra. More details on
theming [here](/docs/theming/customize-theme).

```jsx live=false
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const theme = extendTheme({
  fonts: {
    heading: "Heading Font Name",
    body: "Body Font Name",
  },
})

export default theme
```

Then compose the rest of the project together by importing the `Fonts` component
and `theme` file.

```jsx live=false
import {
  ChakraProvider,
  Container,
  Stack,
  Heading,
  Text,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"
import Fonts from "./fonts"
import theme from "./theme"

const App = () => (
  <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
    <Fonts />
    <Container>
      <Stack>
        <Heading>The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</Heading>
        <Text>
          Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the
          sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same
          illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the
          spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and
          the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose
          upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf
          below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the
          clouds.
        </Text>
      </Stack>
    </Container>
  </ChakraProvider>
)
```
