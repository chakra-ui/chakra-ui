## Why add font files?

The design team has made (or was given) a custom font in font files, such as
`woff`, `woff2`, and `eot`. It is not hosted through a cloud provider (Google
Fonts, Typography.com, Typekit, etc). We need to take the font files we have and
bundle them with our Next.js app to make sure the end-user sees our beautiful
design.

## Put font files in `public` folder

For Next.js (and possibly Create-React-App), place your font files in your
`public` folder. Optionally, inside the `public` folder, put the font files in a
`fonts` folder. This is mostly to keep things tidy.

Now that our font files are in the public folder, Next.js should have access to
them when we deploy (much like our favicons).

## Override Chakra theme fonts

For ease of use, I am going to override the default theme in Chakra. At the same
folder level as `public`, create a new folder called `styles`. Inside `styles`,
create a `theme.js` or `theme.ts` file. Inside `theme.js`, export your overrides
using this template:

```js
export default {
  fonts: {
    body: "'My Body Font', sans-serif",
    heading: "'My Heading Font', sans-serif",
    mono: "'My Monospaced Font', monospace",
  },
}
```

It would be a good idea to include a _native_ font stack for fallbacks between
"My \* Font" and the ultra generic `sans-serif` or `serif`. Feel free to remove
any options you do not need (like mono) if you don't have a custom font to use.

## Import fonts from `public` folder

We need to bring our custom fonts from the `public` folder and put them where
Chakra can find them. Inside your `styles` folder, create another `js/ts` file
called `font-face`. We're putting our `@font-face` imports in here to keep our
`_app.js` easier to read. Also, depending on how many fonts you have, this part
could get long. Better to have it in its own file.

In your `font-face.js` file, use this template and replace it with the names of
your font files:

```js
export default `
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'My Body Font';
      font-style: normal;
      font-weight: 400;
      font-display: swap;
      src: url(fonts/MyBodyRegular.woff2) format('woff2');
      url(fonts/MyBodyRegular.woff) format('woff');
      url(fonts/MyBodyRegular.eot) format('eot');
      unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
    }
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'My Heading Font';
      font-style: italic;
      font-weight: 400;
      font-display: swap;
      src: url(fonts/MyHeadingItalic.woff2) format('woff2');
      url(fonts/MyHeadingItalic.woff) format('woff');
      url(fonts/MyHeadingItalic.eot) format('eot');
      unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
    }
  `
```

Keep in mind, you will need to do an `@font-face` object for every font variant.
For example, if the Heading font has `regular`, `italic`, `bold`, and
`bolditalic`, you will need four declarations with the appropriate `font-style`,
`font-weight`, and `src` attributes updated appropriately. The good news is you
only have to do this once. As to what is going on in `unicode-range`, I do not
entirely know. It came from
[this github issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/1791). It does
not appear to cause any harm. If you experience bad mojo, submit a PR and we can
revise this guide.

## Add theme and fonts to `<ChakraProvider>` in `_app.js`

Everything is in place to add to the default of Chakra and impact our app. If it
is not there already, create an `_app.js` or `_app.ts` file in the `pages`
folder. Use this as a template to get going:

```jsx
import { ChakraProvider, Global, extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import myTheme from "styles/theme"
import fonts from "styles/font-face"

const theme = extendTheme(myTheme)

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Global styles={fonts} />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

Now you're ready to use the default Chakra UI components with your custom fonts.
Even better, your `theme.js` file is ready for any other
overrides/customizations (like colors) you might want to use.
