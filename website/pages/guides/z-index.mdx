Every UI has stackable layers and it's important to have control over how these
layers play together. Some examples of stackable layers are tooltips, modals,
popovers, selects, dropdowns, and menus.

The issues that come up across the usage of these these layers are related to
z-index and visibility handling, in other words, "what layer goes on top?"

## What's wrong with z-index?

You might have encountered this if you've worked in codebases with
`z-index: 9999`. This technique is an attempt to ensure than an element is
always on top of all other elements.

But this method isn't as safe as you might think:

- It introduces scaling issues, which you can manage with global values (such as
  a [theme](/docs/theming/theme#z-index-values)).
- Components are still constrained and impacted by stacking contexts.

### Stacking contexts

A stacking context can be created in many ways, and here are just a few
examples:

- Element with a `position: absolute` or `position: relative` and `z-index`
  value other than `auto`.
- An element with an `opacity` value less than `1`.
- An element with a `transform` or `filter` applied.
- A child of a flexbox or grid container with a `z-index` other than `auto`.

Once a stacking context is created, the `z-index` rules of the any child
stacking context(s) now only have meaning in this parent.

## Chakra Portal to the rescue

An alternative to `z-index` is to use the DOM's natural stacking order to our
advantage. [React's Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) allow us to
insert a child into a different location in the document, whilst not affecting
other behaviours in React such as event bubbling.

Chakra Portal implementation allows for nesting, and defaults to inserting
children at the end of `document.body`.

With this approach, you can create a stacking context for your application, and
be certain that any children you render with Portal will always appear on top of
everything else in your application, regardless of child stacking contexts.

This is particularly useful for components like modals and toast notifications.

### Can I still use z-index alongside Portals?

Yes, there are many cases where this will make sense.

As a general rule, we recommend not exceeding `z-index` values of more than `1`
or `2`, and to use stacking contexts to combat more complex stacking issues.
