Thanks for being interested in contributing! We're so glad you want to help!

We want contributing to Chakra UI to be enjoyable and educational for anyone and
everyone. All contributions are welcome, including: issues, new docs, as well as
updates and tweaks, blog posts, workshops, and more.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct). Please follow it
in all of your interactions with the project and our community.

## Getting started

Please create a new branch from an up to date `master` on your fork. (Note:
urgent hotfixes should be branched off the latest stable release rather than
`master`)

- Fork the Chakra UI repository on Github
- Clone your fork to your local machine
  `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/chakra-ui.git`
- Create a branch `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
- Make your changes, lint, then push to GitHub with
  `git push --set-upstream origin my-feature-branch`.
- Visit GitHub and make your pull request.

If you have an existing local repository, please update it before you start, to
minimise the chance of merge conflicts.

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:chakra-ui/chakra-ui.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

## Docs contribution

Chakra UI uses Gatsby for its documentation website. Thank you in advance and
cheers for contributing to our documentation! We created a simple command to run
it.

```sh
npm run docs:start
```

You can now access the documentation site locally. Changes to the docs will hot
reload the site.

### Documentation Goals

As an organization, we've established a few goals for our documentation in order
to keep them accessible, friendly, and useful.

- Docs should be friendly and human

Our documentation should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill
level with React. This means we should try to write documentation that someone
totally new to React can get started with.

It also means that we want the voice of our docs to be casual and
straightforward. We want people to fall in love with Chakra and have fun with
it, and our docs should reflect that desire!

- Cover FAQs and common issues

Chakra has a lot going on with it! In order to help users as much as possible,
we want our documentation to cover frequently asked questions and common issues.

- Copy-able

Code snippets should be easily copied and pasted. We should also try to cover as
many use cases as possible for each component, so that users can learn by code
example as much as they can by reading through the docs.

### Notes on Github Token

By default, the GitHub REST API has an anonymous user rate limit. This can be
hit during heavy local docs development if the server is frequently restarted.

Creating a GitHub token and storing it as the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable allows the user to avoid the limit.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
