  "React hook for getting the value for the current breakpoint from the provided
  responsive values object."
---

`useBreakpointValue` is a custom hook which returns the value for the current
breakpoint from the provided responsive values object. This hook also responds
to the window resizing, returning the appropriate value for the new window size.

The new `variant` and `size` props don't currently accept responsive values
(specified as objects or arrays), but `useBreakpointValue` is a good way to
achieve the same behavior.

## Import

```js
import { useBreakpointValue } from "@chakra-ui/media-query"
```

## Return value

The `useBreakpointValue` hook returns the value for the current breakpoint.

## Usage

```jsx
function Example() {
  const variant = useBreakpointValue({ base: "outline", md: "solid" })

  return (
    <Button colorScheme="teal" variant={variant}>
      Resize your window to see the button variant change
    </Button>
  )
}
```
