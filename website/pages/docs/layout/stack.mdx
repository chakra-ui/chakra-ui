Stack is a layout component that makes it easy to stack elements together and
apply a space between them. It uses a modified version of the
[CSS lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/)
to add spacing between its children.

## Import

```js
import { Stack, HStack, VStack } from "@chakra-ui/react"
```

- **Stack:** Used to add spacing between elements in the horizontal or vertical
  direction. It supports responsive values.
- **HStack:** Used to add spacing between elements in horizontal direction, and
  centers them.
- **VStack:** Used to add spacing between elements in vertical direction only,
  and centers them.

## Usage

To stack elements in horizontal or vertical direction only, use the `HStack` or
`VStack` components. You can also use the `Stack` component as well and pass the
`direction` prop.

```jsx
<HStack spacing="24px">
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="yellow.200">
    1
  </Box>
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="tomato">
    2
  </Box>
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="pink.100">
    3
  </Box>
</HStack>
```

### Responsive direction

You can pass responsive values to the `Stack` component to change stack
direction and/or spacing between elements.

```jsx
<Stack direction={["column", "row"]} spacing="24px">
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="yellow.200">
    1
  </Box>
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="tomato">
    2
  </Box>
  <Box w="40px" h="40px" bg="pink.100">
    3
  </Box>
</Stack>
```

### Adding dividers

In some scenarios, you may want to add dividers between stacked elements. Pass
the `divider` prop and set its value to the `StackDivider` or any custom React
element.

```jsx
<VStack
  divider={<StackDivider borderColor="gray.200" />}
  spacing={4}
  align="stretch"
>
  <Box h="40px" bg="yellow.200">
    1
  </Box>
  <Box h="40px" bg="tomato">
    2
  </Box>
  <Box h="40px" bg="pink.100">
    3
  </Box>
</VStack>
```

### Example

```jsx manual=true
function Feature({ title, desc, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Box p={5} shadow="md" borderWidth="1px" {...rest}>
      <Heading fontSize="xl">{title}</Heading>
      <Text mt={4}>{desc}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

function StackEx() {
  return (
    <Stack spacing={8}>
      <Feature
        title="Plan Money"
        desc="The future can be even brighter but a goal without a plan is just a wish"
      />
      <Feature
        title="Save Money"
        desc="You deserve good things. With a whooping 10-15% interest rate per annum, grow your savings on your own terms with our completely automated process"
      />
    </Stack>
  )
}

render(<StackEx />)
```

### Stack items horizontally

Pass the `direction` and set it to `row`. Optionally, you can use `align` and
`justify` to adjust the alignment and distribution of the items.

```jsx manual=true
function Feature({ title, desc, ...rest }) {
  return (
    <Box
      p={5}
      shadow="md"
      borderWidth="1px"
      flex="1"
      borderRadius="md"
      {...rest}
    >
      <Heading fontSize="xl">{title}</Heading>
      <Text mt={4}>{desc}</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}

function StackEx() {
  return (
    <HStack spacing={8}>
      <Feature
        title="Plan Money"
        desc="The future can be even brighter but a goal without a plan is just a wish"
      />
      <Feature
        title="Save Money"
        desc="You deserve good things. With a whooping 10-15% interest rate per annum, grow your savings."
      />
    </HStack>
  )
}

render(<StackEx />)
```

### Notes on Stack vs Flex

Stack's primary use case is to lay items out and control the spacing between
each item. If you have a more complicated use case, such as changing the margin
on the last child, you can combine `Stack` and `Flex` and use
`justify-content: space-between` for more control of the layout.

### Props

<PropsTable of="Stack" />
