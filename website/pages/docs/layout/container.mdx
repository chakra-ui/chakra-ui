  Containers are the most basic layout element in Chakra. It's used to constrain
  the maximum of the content it wraps.

import ComponentLinks from "../../../src/components/component-links"

Containers are used to constrain a content's width to the current breakpoint,
while keeping it fluid.

By default, it sets the `max-width` of the content to 60 characters (`60ch`) but
you can customize this by passing custom `maxWidth` values or change the
container size tokens defined in `theme.sizes.container`

<ComponentLinks
  github={{ url: "#" }}
  storybook={{ url: "#" }}
  npm={{ label: "@chakra-ui/layout", url: "#" }}
/>

## Usage

To contain any piece of content, wrap in the `Container` component.

```jsx
<Container>
  There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
  does it bring benefits to the design team, but it also brings benefits to
  engineering teams. It makes sure that our experiences have a consistent look
  and feel, not just in our design specs, but in production
</Container>
```

## Centering the children

In some cases, the width of the content can be smaller than the container's
width, you can use the `centerContent` prop to center the content.

```jsx live=false
<Container maxW="xl" centerContent>
  <Box padding="4" bg="gray.100" maxW="3xl">
    There are many benefits to a joint design and development system. Not only
    does it bring benefits to the design team.
  </Box>
</Container>
```

## Props

Container composes `Box` so you can pass all `Box` related props in addition to
this.

| Props           | Type      | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `centerContent` | `boolean` | If `true`, it'll center child elements based on their content width |
