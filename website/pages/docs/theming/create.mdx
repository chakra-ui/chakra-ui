In this document, we'll explain how to create your own custom components
separate from the ones that ship with Chakra.

## Introduction

Before diving into creating custom components, we need to explain a few key
concepts.

### Base styles vs. modifier styles

Components typically have **base styles** which represent the component in its
default state and **modifier styles** that alter its size or visual style based
on some properties or state.

Base styles are simplest, and contain just the CSS-in-JS properties themselves:

```js
{
  baseStyle: {
    fontFamily: "body",
    fontSize: "16px",
    // ...
  }
}
```

Some common modifier styles are:

- **Size:** A component can have different sizes (e.g. small, medium, large)
- **Variant:** A component can different visual styles (e.g. outline, solid,
  ghost)
- **Color scheme:** For a given variant, a component can have different color
  schemes (e.g. an outline button with a red color scheme)
- **Color mode:** A component can change its visual styles based on color mode
  (e.g. light or dark).

We'll go over how to implement modifier styles later.

### Single-part vs. multi-part components

Most components we build today are either single-part components (e.g. Button,
Badge) or multi-part components (e.g. Tabs, Menu, Modal).

**A single-part component** is a component that represents a single element. For
example, the `<Button>` component renders a `<button>` HTML element:

```jsx live=false
// This component renders only one element (<button>)
<Button>My button</Button>
```

**A multi-part component** is a component that has nested children. For example,
the `<Tabs>` component renders a wrapper component and other related child
components:

```jsx live=false
// This component renders a wrapper (<Tabs>) and has multiple child components:
// <TabList>, <Tab>, <TabPanels>, and <TabPabel>
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Tab 1</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Tab 1</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

## Creating a custom single-part component

The first step in creating a custom component is to create a file to export the
style object. This object, as stated earlier, will contain all the base styles
and modifier styles for the component.

We will then import that style object into the global theme. If you haven't set
up a global `theme.js` (or `theme.ts`) file yet, we suggest you read the
documentation for [modifying existing components](/docs/theming/modify) first.

To style single-part components, you'll need to define your style object. It
will always have the exact same structure:

```jsx live=false
export default {
  // Styles for the base style
  baseStyle: {},
  // Styles for the size variations
  sizes: {},
  // Styles for the visual style variations
  variants: {},
  // The default `size` or `variant` values
  defaultProps: {},
}
```

Let's say we want to create a custom button component. The follow is a contrived
example of how this might be done:

```jsx live=false
// theme/components/my-custom-button.js
export default {
  // The absolute bare minimum base styles that all sizes and variants have in common
  baseStyle: {
    fontWeight: "bold",
    textTransform: "uppercase",
  },
  // Two sizes: sm and md
  sizes: {
    sm: {
      fontSize: "12px",
      padding: "16px",
    },
    md: {
      fontSize: "16px",
      padding: "24px",
    },
  },
  // Two variants: outline and solid
  variants: {
    outline: {
      border: "2px solid",
      borderColor: "green.500",
    },
    solid: {
      bg: "green.500",
      color: "white",
    },
  },
  // The default size and variant values
  defaultProps: {
    size: "md",
    variant: "outline",
  },
}
```

Make sense?

Now we'll want to wire this style object into the global theme just like we did
when we [modified existing Chakra components](/docs/theming/modify).

```jsx live=false
// theme/index.js
import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
import { merge } from "@chakra-ui/utils"

import MyCustomButton from "./components/my-custom-button"

const overrides = {
  components: {
    MyCustomButton,
  },
}

export default merge(theme, overrides)
```

At this point, the style object is hooked into the theme and we can associate it
with a React component.

```jsx live=false
// components/MyCustomButton.js
import React from "react"
import { useStyleConfig } from "@chakra-ui/system"

export default (props) => {
  const { size, variant, ...rest } = props
  const styles = useStyleConfig("MyCustomButton", { size, variant })

  return <Box as="button" sx={styles} {...rest} />
}
```

And lastly - the fun part - let's use our newly created custom component
somewhere in our app:

```jsx live=false
const Example = () => {
  return <MyCustomButton>Click me</MyCustomButton>
}
```

## Creating a custom multi-part component

Following up on what we learned by creating a single-part component, we can
apply the same logic to creating a mulit-part component. There's only a few
differences that you need to be aware of.

Firstly, you'll need to add a special `parts` key to your style object, like
such:

```jsx live=false
export default {
  // Defining what the "parts" of the multi-part component are
  parts: [],
  // Styles for the base style
  baseStyle: {},
  // Styles for the size variations
  sizes: {},
  // Styles for the visual style variations
  variants: {},
  // The default `size` or `variant` values
  defaultProps: {},
}
```

You'll also now be able to nest another level of keys in your style object,
here's the theoretical example of a custom menu component:

```jsx live=false
// theme/components/my-custom-menu.js
export default {
  parts: ["menu", "item"],
  baseStyle: {
    menu: {
      flexDirection: "column",
    },
    item: {
      fontWeight: "bold",
      textTransform: "uppercase",
    },
  },
  sizes: {
    sm: {
      item: {
        fontSize: [1, null, 2],
      },
    },
    md: {
      item: {
        fontSize: 2,
      },
    },
  },
  defaultProps: {
    size: "md",
  },
}
```

Assuming we associate this style object with the global theme like we did for
the single-part component, we can now bring it into our React component:

```jsx live=false
// components/MyCustomMenu.js
import React from "react"
import Flex from "@chakra-ui/flex"
import Box from "@chakra-ui/box"
import { StylesProvider, useStyleConfig, useStyles } from "@chakra-ui/system"

export const MyCustomMenu = (props) => {
  const { size, variant, children, ...rest } = props
  const styles = useStyleConfig("MyCustomMenu", { size, variant })

  return (
    // Mount the computed styles on styles provider
    <StylesProvider value={styles}>
      <Flex sx={styles.menu}>{children}</Flex>
    </StylesProvider>
  )
}

export const MyCustomMenuItem = (props) => {
  // Read computed styles from styles provider, and consume the `item` styles
  const styles = useStyles()
  return <Box sx={styles.item} {...props} />
}
```

There's a few things going on here, let's break all that down:

1. We declare our parent and child components (`<Menu>` and `<MenuItem>`).
2. In the parent component (`<Menu>`), we use the `useStyleConfig` function just
   as we did before.
3. We wrap our parent component in a `<StylesProvider>` component and pass the
   result of `useStyleConfig`.
4. The previous step then allows us to use dot-notation to inject the styles
   into the parent component using the `sx` prop.
5. In the child component we get the styles from the parent component using the
   `useStyles` function, and again use dot-notation on the `sx` props.

After all of this is done, we can use our newly created multi-part component in
our application:

```jsx live=false
const Example = () => {
  return (
    <MyCustomMenu>
      <MyCustomMenuItem>Awesome</MyCustomMenuItem>
      <MyCustomMenuItem>Sauce</MyCustomMenuItem>
    </MyCustomMenu>
  )
}
```
