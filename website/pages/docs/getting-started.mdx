description: How to install and set up Chakra UI in your project
---

## Installation

Inside your React project directory, install Chakra UI by running the following:

```bash
npm i @chakra-ui/core@next
# or
yarn add @chakra-ui/core@next
```

> For `create-react-app` installation instructions, check this
> [CRA templates guide](/guides/integrations/with-cra)

## Setup Provider

For Chakra UI to work correctly, you need to setup the `ChakraProvider` at the
root of your application. You also add browser css reset styles by passing the
`resetCSS` prop.

Go to the root of your application, and do this:

```jsx live=false
import * as React from "react"

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/core"

function App() {
  // 2. Use at the root of your app and pass `resetCSS` prop
  return (
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> - For Next.js, you need to set this up in `pages/_app.js` or `pages/_app.tsx`
> - For Gatsby, install the `gatsby-plugin-chakra-ui`. It does it automatically
>   for you.
> - For Create React App, you need to set this up in `index.js` or `index.tsx`

## Add Custom theme (Optional)

If you need to customize the default chakra theme to match your design
requirements, you can extend the `theme` from `@chakra-ui/core`.

```jsx live=false
// 1. Import the theme
import { theme } from "@chakra-ui/core"

// 2. Extend the theme to include custom colors, fonts, etc.
const customTheme = merge(theme, {
  colors: {
    brand: {
      900: "#1a365d",
      800: "#153e75",
      700: "#2a69ac",
    },
  },
})

// 3. Pass the `theme` prop to the `ChakraProvider`
function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider resetCSS theme={customTheme}>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

That's it, you're good to go!

## Notes on TypeScript 🚨

Please note that when adding Chakra UI to a TypeScript project, a minimum
TypeScript version of `3.8.0` is required.

If you're adding Chakra UI to a `create-react-app` project, this means you'll
need to manually upgrade `typescript` to `^3.8.0`.

See [the guide for our create-react-app](../guides/cra-templates) templates if
you'd like to generate a Chakra-enabled `create-react-app` project from scratch.
