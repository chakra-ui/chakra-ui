When building a product, website, or application, it's a common question to
consider the design system or component library to use to help you ship quality
products fast, and deliver value to your customers in a way that scales with
your team.

Here's a comparison between Chakra UI and other popular UI or CSS frameworks
like Theme UI, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI help you make the best decision.

## How's Chakra different from Tailwind CSS?

### Overview 🚩

**Tailwind CSS**: CSS Framework that provides atomic CSS classes to help you
**style** components, leaving you to handle lots of other things like
accessibility, component composition, keyboard navigation, style overrides, etc.

**Chakra UI**: A library of carefully created React components that comes with
all the styling benefits of Tailwind and takes care of all the details.

### Learning Curve 🌀

**Tailwind CSS:** If you come from a bootstrap or bulma CSS background, you
might find it easy to pick up Tailwind. However, from a `styled-components` or
`emotion` background, the learning curve can be rather steep.

**Chakra UI**: Comes with a very intuitive, CSS-like, and prop based model of
styling components, making it easy to learn. The components name and prop names
are also very easy to understand.

### Responsive Styles 📱

**Tailwind CSS**: Authoring responsive styles in tailwind requires a combination
of pseudo-classes. This can get rather lengthy as your project grows. The API:
`<img class="w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48" src="...">`

**Chakra UI**: Authoring responsive styles in a very easy and intuitive. You can
use either the array or object notation.

The API:

- Array syntax: `<Img w={[16, 32, 48]} src="...">`
- Object syntax: `<Img w={{ base: 16, md: 32, lg: 48 }} src="..." />`

### Style Overrides 💫

In most applications, its a common challenge to want to override styles for a
specific context to match design requirements.

**Tailwind CSS**: Given that Tailwind is a CSS utility framework, you might need
to do figure out the best way to override specific classNames, or write custom
CSS.

**Chakra UI**: Given that Chakra UI styles are prop-based, overrides is as easy
as passing a prop.

### Accessibility ♿️

As mentioned earlier, Tailwind CSS is simply a CSS framework similar to
Bootstrap or Bulma CSS. This leaves to handle semantic html structure, meeting
the WAI-ARIA requirements, keyboard navigation, etc.

Chakra provides the convenience of Tailwind and all these benefits out the box.

### Dark Mode 🌜

**Tailwind CSS**: Not supported.

**Chakra UI**: All components are light and dark mode compatible. You can also
author your own light and dark mode experience across your application.

## How's Chakra different from Theme UI?

- Chakra UI was heavily inspired by Theme UI and follows the system UI
  specifications.
- Chakra UI provide more components, improved styling API, accessibility, and
  intuive component APIs than Theme UI.
- Think of Chakra as a more robust version of Theme UI that leverages the full
  power of `styled-system` to provide better component styles and theming.

## The Runtime Trade-off ⚠️

Since Chakra UI uses CSS-in-JS under the hood (`emotion` + `styled system`),
this flexibility comes with a small price to pay when it comes to runtime. This
runtime footprint is caused by style computations by `styled-system`, and
className generation by `emotion`.

If your app deals with high, frequently changing data that is performance
sensitive, you might notice this footprint as your app grows.

We recommend you compare with alternatives before making the decision to use
Chakra, however, for most small or medium data-driven applications, we think
Chakra UI is a perfect.

## The Community 💖

My favourite thing about Chakra UI is the community around it. Despite it still
being small for now, it's growing daily and, everyone is so helpful and we keep
striving for ways to improve Chakra UI's speed, performance and developer
experience.

## Community Remarks 💬

"When I'm pitching Chakra, my main selling point is that Chakra makes it easier
to customize components to be entirely your own. MUI has a distinctly "material"
look that is difficult to get rid of even if you want to. Chakra strikes a
balance of look nice out of the box and can morph into anything"

"When we were in the process of choosing a component library, like most others
that found Chakra, we were looking for something that did a lot of the heavy
lifting for us whilst being as unopinionated as possible. This was a big reason
that ruled most of the big players out (MUI, Ant). These big players are
awesome, don't get me wrong, but because they come with their own design
languages, you're kinda stuck with their look.

Then there were a bunch of other medium/small players, such as variations of
Bootstrap in React. Among other small issues, these libraries generally don't
have large hyper-active communities.

Then, I found Chakra.

- ✅ A wide range of well-thought components.
- ✅ Unopinionated. Chakra gives you the tools to easily make your components
  look the way you want.
- ✅ Built with accessibility in mind! You mean I don't have to worry about that
  anymore!?
- ✅ Amazing community, lead by a great team. ❤️

I feel like Chakra is becoming a movement, and I'm excited for it."
