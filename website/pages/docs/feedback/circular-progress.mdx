- Determinate progress: fills the circular track with color, as the indicator
  moves from 0 to 360 degrees.
- Indeterminate progress: grows and shrinks the indicator while moving along the
  circular track.

## Import

```js
import { CircularProgress, CircularProgressLabel } from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

## Usage

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={80} />
```

### Changing the size

You can add `size` prop to the progressbar to add a custom size.

```jsx
// Change the size to 120px
<CircularProgress value={30} size="120px" />
```

### Changing the thickness

You can add the `thickness` prop to update the thickness of the progress ring.

> The thickness has to be a ratio of the size. Value should be between 0 and 1.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={59} size="100px" thickness="4px" />
```

### Changing the color

You can add `color` prop to any progressbar to apply any color that exists in
the theme.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={30} color="orange.400" thickness="12px" />
```

### Adding label

Chakra exports a `CircularProgressLabel` to help you add a label. Pass this
component as children and you'll be able to render the value.

```jsx
<CircularProgress value={40} color="green.400">
  <CircularProgressLabel>40%</CircularProgressLabel>
</CircularProgress>
```

### Indeterminate Progress

Setting the progress to indeterminate means you're not able to determine the
`value` upfront. Pass the `isIndeterminate` prop to activate this state.

```jsx
<CircularProgress isIndeterminate color="green.300"></CircularProgress>
```

### Accessibility

- Progress has `role` set to `progressbar` to denote that it's a progress bar
- Progress has `aria-valuenow` set to the percentage completion value passed to
  the component, to ensure the progress percent is visible to screen readers.
