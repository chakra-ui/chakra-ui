description: Using the chakra factory and elements
---

Chakra factory serves as an **object of chakra enabled JSX elements**, and also
**a function that can be used to enable custom component** receive chakra's
style props.

```bash
import { chakra } from "@chakra-ui/core"
```

## Chakra JSX Elements

Create base html elements with theme-aware style props using `chakra.<element>`
notation. For example, if you want a plain html button with ability to pass
chakra styles, you can write `<chakra.button />`.

```jsx
<chakra.button
  px="3"
  py="2"
  bg="green.200"
  rounded="md"
  _hover={{ bg: "green.300" }}
>
  Click me
</chakra.button>
```

This reduces the need to create custom component wrappers and name them. This
syntax is available for common html elements. See the reference for the full
[list of elements](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/develop/packages/system/src/system.utils.ts#L9)
supported.

```jsx live=false
<chakra.h1 fontSize="lg"> Heading </chakra.h1>
```

## Chakra factory function

This is a function that converts **non-chakra components** or **jsx element** to
chakra-enabled components so you can pass style props to them.

Consider a package called `react-input-autoresize`, let's use the chakra factory
function to make possible to pass style props.

The function will infer the prop types from the wrapped component and also add
chakra style props.

```jsx live=false
import { chakra } from "@chakra-ui/core"
import Textarea from "react-input-autoresize"

const AutoResizeInput = chakra(Textarea)

function Example() {
  return <AutoResizeInput bg="red.200" fontSize="12px" />
}
```

> Considering that Chakra uses `emotion` under the hood, ensure the non-chakra
> component accepts `className` as props for this to work correctly

### Attaching styles

In some instances, you might need to attach specific styles to the component
wrapped in the chakra factory

```jsx live=false
const AutoResizeInput = chakra(AutoResizeInput, {
  baseStyle: {
    bg: "papayawhip",
    color: "red.500",
  },
})
```

You can also use the chakra factory on jsx elements as well.

```jsx live=false
const Card = chakra("div", {
  baseStyle: {
    shadow: "lg",
    rounded: "lg",
    bg: "white",
  },
})
```
