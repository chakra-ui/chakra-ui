## Import

```js
import { Kbd } from '@chakra-ui/react'
```

## Usage

```jsx
<span>
  <Kbd>shift</Kbd> + <Kbd>H</Kbd>
</span>
```

## Representing a sequence of keyboard

For a sequence of keys where one must follow the other, write "then" in between.
Use lowercase to match the non-letter keys.

```jsx
<span>
  <Kbd>shift</Kbd> then <Kbd>H</Kbd>
</span>
```

If two different keys can execute the same action or the shortcut itself may
look different on the user's keyboard, write "or" in between.

```jsx
<span>
  <Kbd>alt</Kbd> or <Kbd>option</Kbd>
</span>
```
