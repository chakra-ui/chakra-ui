The default way to add color mode in your application or website is to wrap it
in the `ChakraProvider` which provides a way to change the color mode to `light`
or `dark` depending on system/user preferences.

In reality, you might run into scenarios where you want to lock a page to a
specific color mode (light or dark).

A combination of `LightMode` or `DarkMode` components and the _undocumented_
`GlobalStyle` component can help you achieve this.

The `GlobalStyle` component provides the styles defined in `theme.styles.global`
to the elements on entire page.

> **Note ðŸš¨:** The caveat of this approach is that you won't be able to switch
> between color modes. You're effectively "locking" the mode.

Let's say we want to lock the page to light mode, you can import the `LightMode`
component and wrap the page within it.

```jsx live=false
import { LightMode, GlobalStyle } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function Page() {
  return (
    <LightMode>
      <GlobalStyle />
      {/* rest of your page */}
    </LightMode>
  )
}
```
