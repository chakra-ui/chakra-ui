## Introduction

This is the Chakra UI tutorial. Here you will be able to learn about how to work
with Chakra UI and its features.

## Code along

You will be able to code along the tutorial without opening a separate IDE. You
will come accross buttons with code actions to help you. This could look like
this:

Open your <TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/App.tsx' /> file.

You will also find code blocks with step by step examples. You can copy the code
to the codesandbox by clicking on the top right button in the codeblock. Like
this you focus more on the conten and less on the typing. Try it out:

```tsx path=/App.tsx type=tutorial
import { Center, ChakraProvider, Heading } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Center h='100vh'>
        <Heading>Hello World</Heading>
      </Center>
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> Copying the code from codeblocks always replaces the complete code in the file
> of codesandbox

<TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/package.json' />
<TutorialFileAction type='open' path='/App.tsx' />
<TutorialFileAction type='add' path='/Test.tsx' />
<TutorialFileAction type='delete' path='/Test.tsx' />
