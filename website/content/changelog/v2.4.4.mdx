## Minor Changes

### Styled System `2.5.0`

- Reverted `isTruncated` to solve some edge cases with `noOfLines={1}`

### Gatsby Plugin `3.1.0`

- Added option to use `ChakraBaseProvider` instead of `ChakraProvider`2. This
  will only apply theme tokens only and exlude theming for components.

## Patch Changes

### Card `2.1.3`

- Fixed issue where `CardFooter` style could not be overriden from theme.

### Icons `2.0.14`

- Added `ReactIcon` to align with Figma UI Kit

### Skeleton `2.0.20`

- Added support for `fitContent` prop.

  When set to `true`, the `Skeleton` will take the width of its children.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Skeleton fitContent>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </Skeleton>
  ```

- Fixed issue where `Skeleton` styles could not be `overidden` in dark mode

### Slider `2.0.16`

- Expose `RangeSliderState` and `RangeSliderActions` types to improve
  documentation

### Table `2.0.13`

- Added the `layout` prop to set the `tableLayout` CSS property.

### CLI `2.2.1`

- Improved support for TS config paths
