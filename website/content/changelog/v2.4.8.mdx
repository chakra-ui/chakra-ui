## Minor Changes

### System `2.4.0`

- Fixed issue where TS throws an error when using the `translate` style prop due
  to clash with the native DOM translate attribute.

  This was fixed by omitting the native `translate` attribute and introducing a
  new `htmlTranslate` attribute for user who need this.

## Patch Changes

### All components

- Refactor code to use explicit exports

### Modal `2.2.8`

- Bump `react-remove-scroll`, `react-focus-lock` and `aria-hidden` dependencies
- Fix issue where console throws a warning from react-remove-scroll when
  multiple modal dialogs are open.

### Icons `2.0.17`

- Fixed issue where `ReactIcon` was not exported

### Theme `2.2.5`

- Refactored `Card` theme to use component tokens. This makes it easier to
  override styles from the base style.

### Styled System `2.5.2`

- Fixed issue where `useBreakpointValue` resolves to an incorrect value when
  resizing the window in `Firefox`

## Hooks `2.1.5`

- Fixed issue where `useDimensions` uses stale value of node reference

## Toast `5.0.0`

- Fixed issue where default toast options are not applied correctly.
