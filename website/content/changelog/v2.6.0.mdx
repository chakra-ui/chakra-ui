## New Component

### Stepper

Introduce new `Stepper` component to model sequencial steps in a process.

```jsx live=false
<Stepper index={activeStep}>
  {steps.map((step, index) => (
    <Step key={index}>
      <StepIndicator>
        <StepStatus
          complete={<StepIcon />}
          incomplete={<StepNumber />}
          active={<StepNumber />}
        />
      </StepIndicator>

      <Box>
        <StepTitle>{step.title}</StepTitle>
        <StepDescription>{step.description}</StepDescription>
      </Box>

      <StepSeparator />
    </Step>
  ))}
</Stepper>
```

## Minor Changes

### Editable

Adds `finalFocusRef` and `onBlur` to Editable component

### Theme

Add semantic tokens for inverse text and subtle text

### Styled System

- Add support for native `aspectRatio` style prop

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box aspectRatio='16/9' />
  ```

- Add support for nested semantic tokens in theme. It is now possible to declare
  semantic tokens by nesting objects.

  BEFORE:

  ```js
  const theme = {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        'background.pressed.base': { default: 'blue.800', _dark: 'blue.300' },
        'background.pressed.subtle': { default: 'blue.300', _dark: 'blue.700' },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  AFTER:

  ```js
  const theme = {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        background: {
          pressed: {
            base: { default: 'blue.800', _dark: 'blue.300' },
            subtle: { default: 'blue.300', _dark: 'blue.700' },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  This allows for cleaner grouping and organization of tokens.

- Add `_horizontal` and `_vertical` pseudo props to style orientation data
  attributes

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box _horizontal={{ width: '2px' }} _vertical={{ height: '4px' }} />
  ```

### Toast

Update element types for toast list and item to apply appropriate accessibility
roles

- Fix issue where some `next/image` props were not forwarded to the underlying
  component.

### Gatsby Plugin `3.1.3`

Reverts the use of the `baseTheme` in the plugin

With the added features of `extendBaseTheme` and `ChakraBaseProvider`, it was
determined that the provider is considered unnecessary.

> Custom theming is to be expected for components when there are no defaults
> rendered.

For Gatsby, this means that the plugin can be reverted back to it's original
setup, and still be able to accept `extendBaseTheme` to reduce the payload of
the component themes when customizing them.
