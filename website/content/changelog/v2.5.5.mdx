## Minor Changes

### Alert `2.1.0`

- Add `data-status` attribute to all alert component parts to allow for better
  finegrained styling

### Styled System `2.8.0`

- Add new `defineCssVars` helper to improve the experience of authoring a set of
  css variables for a component theme.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { defineCssVars } from '@chakra-ui/react'

  // defines the `--badge-bg`, `--badge-border`, and `--badge-size` (with a 1rem fallback)
  const vars = defineCssVars('badge', ['bg', 'border', ['size', '1rem']])

  const style = {
    bg: vars.bg.reference,
    [vars.bg.variable]: 'colors.red.500',
    [vars.border.variable]: 'colors.red.300',
  }
  ```

## Patch Changes

### Styled System `2.8.0`

- Fix TS exhaustive issues with v5.0

- Fix issue where `<Box hideBelow="md" />` behavior was inconsistent with
  `<Hide below="md" />` component

### Css Reset `2.1.1`

- Fix issue where `<input type="number" />` shows spinner button

### Theme `3.0.1`

- Fix issue where tag outline theme doesn't work as expected.

### Toast `6.1.1`

- Fix issue where zIndex was hardcoded in toast component by providing a css
  variable `--toast-z-index` for better override experience.

  You can set the toast's `zIndex` globally by setting a value for the
  `--toast-z-index`. The default value for this variable is `5500`

  ```jsx live=false
  const theme = extendTheme({
    styles: {
      global: {
        '--toast-z-index': 10,
      },
    },
  })
  ```

### Next-js `2.1.2`

- Fix issue where `fill` prop was not forwarded to the underlying component.
