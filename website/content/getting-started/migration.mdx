title: Upgrading to v2
description: How to upgrade your existing Chakra UI projects to v2.0

Chakra UI v2 is focused on providing compatibility for React 18. Doing so we had
to introduce some breaking changes. That lead us to remove some features that we
deprecated previously.

## Upgrade steps

Here is a list of steps to migrate your project to v2.

### 1. Update your dependencies

Make sure you update all `@chakra-ui` packages you use to
`@chakra-ui/<package-name>@2.0.0` and your `react` dependencies to at least v18

> ðŸš¨ Chakra UI v2 is not backwards compatible with React v17 and lower. Make
> sure to upgrade to React v18.

Here is how your dependencies could look like:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@chakra-ui/react": "^2.0.0",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.0.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

Step 2 and 3 are only necessary if you used the mentioned functions in your
project.

### 2. Update createStandaloneToast

We had to make some changes to the our `createStandaloneToast` function, because
of changes in the way React 18 works.

Chakra UI v1 rendered the toast container DOM element for you. The usage of
`createStandaloneToast` could look like this:

```ts
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast'

const toast = createStandaloneToast()
toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' })
```

In v2 you need to render the `ToastContainer` in your application code. This
allows you have only one React root in your application.

Here is an example on how to update your code:

```tsx
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { createStandaloneToast } from '@chakra-ui/toast'

const { ToastContainer, toast } = createStandaloneToast()

// render the ToastContainer in your React root
const rootElement = document.getElementById('root')
ReactDOM.createRoot(yourRootElement).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <ToastContainer />
  </>,
)

toast({ title: 'Chakra UI' })
```

> Please note: There are **no breaking changes** to the hook `useToast`. There
> are only breaking changes to `createStandaloneToast`.

### 3. Color mode update

#### Color mode transition

Ensure the transition between light/dark modes happens instantly without
transition. This helps to avoid a weird UX when switch modes for elements with
different `transition` definition on the page.

To opt out of this feature, set `theme.config.disableTransitionOnChange` to
`false`.

#### Using custom storage keys

Allow user configure the storage key for the provider and script. We now export
a `createLocalStorageManager` and `createCookieStorageManager` functions.

```jsx live=false
const manager = createLocalStorageManager('my-key')

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider colorModeManager={manager}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

If you use `ColorModeScript`, you'll need to configure the `storageKey` from
script as well.

```jsx live=false
<ColorModeScript storageKey='my-key' />
```

#### Improved cookie support

Add support for using cookie storage in color mode script. To use cookie script,
you can set `type` prop to `cookie`.

```jsx live=false
<ColorModeScript type='cookie' />
```

#### Color mode precedence

Refactored color mode to behave consistently between provider and script. The
new precedence is as follows:

- Get the color mode value in the specified `localStorage` or `cookie`
- If value doesn't exist, use the `initialColorMode` value specified.
  - If the initial value is `system`, then we'll compute the color mode using
    `window.matchMedia(...)`
  - else, we use the initial value as is.
- If user specifies `useSystemColorMode: true`, we'll subscribe to color mode
  changes from the operating system.

#### Breaking changes

- In the theme's config, the `useSystemColorMode` property is no longer used to
  determine the initial color mode. To achieve that, please use
  `initialColorMode: "system"`.

  It is now used to only determine whether to subscribe to color mode changes
  from the operating system.

- We removed the references to `--chakra-ui-color-mode`. Use the `data-theme`
  property instead

### 4. Use the new style creation methods

In `v2` we introduced a new way to create component styles. There are three new
methods:

- `defineStyle`
- `defineStyleConfig`
- `defineMultiStyleConfig`

These methods provide a better developer experience. To see how to use them,
check out the Theming docs for any of the components (ex.
[Button Theming](/docs/components/button/theming)).

### 5. Deprecated features

We removed some previously deprecated features from Chakra UI v2. Here is a
detailed list of affected components or packages:

#### Button, Icon Button, Input, NumberInput, Radio, Checkbox, Select

We removed the `isFullWidth` prop from these components. Use `width="full"` or
`width="100%"` instead.

#### Checkbox

We removed the `defaultIsChecked` prop from the `Checkbox` component. Use the
`defaultChecked` prop instead.

#### Hooks

We removed the `useEventCallback` hook

#### Grid

We removed the `area` prop from the `Grid` component. You can pass it to the
`GridItem` component instead.

#### Styled system

We removed the `d` style prop. Use written out `display` prop instead.

We removed the `isTruncated` style prop. You can use `noOfLines={1}` instead and
manually set the `wordBreak` to `break-all`.

#### Theme

We removed deprecated types.
