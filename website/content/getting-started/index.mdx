To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your
terminal:

<PackageManagers
  command={{
    npm: 'npm i @chakra-ui/react@^2 @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    yarn: 'yarn add @chakra-ui/react@^2 @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @chakra-ui/react@^2 @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    bun: 'bun add @chakra-ui/react@^2 @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
  }}
/>

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root
of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or
`App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```

> Version 2 of Chakra UI is only compatible with React 18. If you are still
> needing to use React 17 or earlier, please use
> [version 1 of Chakra UI](https://v1.chakra-ui.com/guides/first-steps).

## Framework Guide

Chakra UI works in your favorite framework. We've put together step-by-step
guides for these frameworks:

## Bundle Size Optimization

This is an optional step and only required for apps that really need to finetune
their bundle size.

The biggest causes of the large initial JS payload is the size of the component
themes. The chakra provides design tokens and component themes.

To reduce the bundle size, use only the design tokens and customize your own
components on a case-by-case basis.

```jsx live=false
import { baseTheme } from '@chakra-ui/theme'
import { Provider } from '@chakra-ui/react/provider'

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider theme={baseTheme}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Provider>
  )
}
```
