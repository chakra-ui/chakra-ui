description: How to install and set up Chakra UI in your project
---

To use Chakra UI in your project, run one of the following commands in your
terminal:

<PackageManagers
  command={{
    npm: 'npm i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    yarn: 'yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    pnpm: 'pnpm add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
    bun: 'bun add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion',
  }}
/>

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the `ChakraProvider` at the root
of your application. This can be either in your `index.jsx`, `index.tsx` or
`App.jsx` depending on the framework you use.

```jsx live=false
import * as React from 'react'

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <TheRestOfYourApplication />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```
