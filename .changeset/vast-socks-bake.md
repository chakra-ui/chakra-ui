Adds a new `@chakra-ui/codemod` package to automate migration from Chakra UI v2
to v3.

The codemod helps developers update renamed props, restructure components, and
refactor theme configurations according to the official
[migration guide](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/get-started/migration). It supports
dry-run mode and aims to reduce manual effort while ensuring compatibility with
v3.
