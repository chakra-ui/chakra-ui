## Minor Changes

### All components

- Allow control of `framer-motion` elements via the `motionProps` prop.

## Patch Changes

### All components

- Added missing component/function docs and relative docsite links.

  Ensures that all Components, functions, and hooks that have detailed pages on
  the Chakra site have corresponding TS Docs and links back to the docsite via
  IDE intellisense.

  Includes adding or fixing links within these docs to related WAI-ARIA
  patterns.

### Menu `2.1.0`

- Remove redundant ARIA roles

## Popover `2.1.0`

- Refactor popover to reduce bundle size

### Tooltip `2.1.0`

- Fixed issue where disabled tooltip triggers require an extra wrapper (via
  `shouldWrapChildren`). This was fixed by switching from mouse events to
  pointer events

### Color Mode `2.1.8`

- Add optional `nonce` back to ColorModeScript

### Layout `2.1.7`

- Fixed an issue where `Highlight` showed `key` warnings
- Prevent `Stack` from crashing when there's a lot of child elements

  > NB: This does not help improve loading and refresh performance otherwise,
  > libraries like `react-virtualized` should be used to handle large lists.

### PinInput `2.0.13`

- Fixed issue where backspace did not focus prev input

### Styled System `2.3.2`

- Revert [#6335](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/6335/files) to fix
  issue where lots of responsive styles makes app slower

- Update disabled selector to use state selector `:disabled`, instead of
  `[disabled]` attribute selector. This is useful when an editable element is
  wrapped within `<fieldset disabled>`

- Improve style resolution when components are wrapped within forced color mode
  elements (`DarkMode`, `LightMode`).

  We now dynamically attach the `data-theme` attribute to chakra elements when
  in forced color mode.

  ```jsx live=false
  <DarkMode>
    <chakra.div bg="gray.800" padding="40px">
      {/* Forced: Badge will now have `data-theme='dark' attached` */}
      <Badge>Total</Badge>
    </chakra.div>
  </DarkMode>
  ```

### Table `2.0.10`

- Remove redundant ARIA roles

### Tag `2.0.10`

- Use `forwardRef` with `TagCloseButton`

### Theme `2.1.12`

- Fix incorrect Select `xs` sizing

### UseControllableState `2.0.4`

- Fixed issue with stale values in callbacks

### UseFocusOnPointerDown `2.0.2`

- Fix issue where focus on pointerdown doesn't work on safari

### DOM Utilities `2.0.2`

- Update disabled selector to use state selector `:disabled`, instead of
  `[disabled]` attribute selector. This is useful when an editable element is
  wrapped within `<fieldset disabled>`
