### Patch Changes

- Moved hooks in their own packages
- General package refactoring & restructuring
- Overall refactor to reduce bundle size

#### @chakra-ui/color-mode@2.1.5:

- Fix regression where `localStorageManager` was not exported

#### @chakra-ui/react-env@2.0.7:

- Omit rendered env span when the environment prop is passed. - Add `id` and
  `hidden` attributes to the rendered env span

#### @chakra-ui/hooks@2.0.7:

- Deprecate `useDimensions` in favor of the `useSize` hook

#### @chakra-ui/react@2.2.7:

- Remove `ChakraProvider.defaultProps` and move logic inside the component.

#### @chakra-ui/styled-system@2.2.6:

- Improve style computation performance by looping over styles once. Previously,
  we had two steps in the logic (expand responsive and convert to css object).
  This can be quite expensive with large css objects (or style props).

  We now process both steps in a single pass.

- Fix regression where `ThemeTypings` created by chakra-cli could not be used
- Escape symbols in css variable to make it work

#### @chakra-ui/theme@2.1.6:

- Improve contrast of `FormHelperText` to satisfy accessibility check
- Fix issue where disabled input with flushed or unstyled variant isn't
  perceivable

#### @chakra-ui/theme-tools@2.0.8:

- Fix regression where `StyleFunctionProps` type was not exported

#### @chakra-ui/utils@2.0.7:

- Add pure annotation to utils package
- Add pure annotation to `isBrowser` to tree-shake when bundling

#### @chakra-ui/cli@2.1.5:

- Fix regression where `ThemeTypings` created by chakra-cli could not be used

#### @chakra-ui/storybook-addon@4.0.7:

- Fix issue with nullish operator in storybook
