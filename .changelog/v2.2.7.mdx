## Patch Changes

### All components

- Moved hooks in their own packages
- General package refactoring & restructuring
- Refactored components to reduce bundle size

### Color Mode `2.1.5`

- Fixed regression where `localStorageManager` was not exported

### React Env `2.0.7`

- Omit rendered env span when the environment prop is passed.
- Added `id` and `hidden` attributes to the rendered env span

### Hooks `2.0.7`

- Deprecated `useDimensions` in favor of the `useSize` hook

### React `2.2.7`

- Removed `ChakraProvider.defaultProps` and move logic inside the component.

### Styled System `2.2.6`

- Improve style computation performance by looping over styles once. Previously,
  we had two steps in the logic (expand responsive and convert to css object).
  This can be quite expensive with large css objects (or style props).

  We now process both steps in a single pass.

- Fixed regression where `ThemeTypings` created by chakra-cli could not be used
- Escape symbols in css variable to make it work

### Theme `2.1.6`

- Improved contrast of `FormHelperText` to satisfy accessibility check
- Fixed issue where disabled input with flushed or unstyled variant isn't
  perceivable

### Theme Utilities `2.0.8`

- Fixed regression where `StyleFunctionProps` type was not exported

### Utilities `2.0.7`

- Added pure annotation to utils package
- Added pure annotation to `isBrowser` to tree-shake when bundling

### CLI `2.1.5`

- Fixed regression where `ThemeTypings` created by chakra-cli could not be used

### Storybook Addon `4.0.7`

- Fixed issue with nullish operator in storybook
