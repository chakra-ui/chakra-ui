## [1.5.0](./#1.5.0) - 2021-07-08

### Fixed

**CLI**

- Fix issue where `tokens` commands doesn't work with `esModuleInterop`
- Fix issue where token generation did not supports non valid JS keys for
  components

### Added

### Changed

## [1.6.4](./#1.6.4) - 2021-06-18

### Fixed

**Menu**

- Fixed menu typeahead behavior
- Fix issue where `closeOnSelect` won't work sometimes

**Toast**

- Resolved an issue where `overflowX` couldn't be used within a toast's `title`
  or `description` by adding `maxWidth="100%"` to the containing `div`.

### Added

**Button**

- Add `className` prop to button spinner
- Update transitions to use theme tokens and remove outline transitions

**Media Query**

- `useBreakpointValue()` now supports receiving a `defaultBreakpoint` as the
  second argument to support SSR/SSG.

**Menu, Popover**

- Added `computePositionOnMount` prop to allow positioning the popover or menu
  before initial open

**System**

- Added the `_activeStep` pseudoselector which is applied when
  `aria-current="step"`.
  [See the `wai-aria` documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-current)
  for more information on `aria-current`.

- The `styled` function allows a functional `baseStyle` property:

```js
import { styled }Â from '@chakra-ui/react'

const MyComponent = styled('div', {
baseStyle: (props) => ({
    bg: props.highlightColor
})
})

// ...

<MyComponent highlightColor="red.500" />
```

**CLI**

The `tokens` command now supports generating theme token type definitions from a
Chakra UI theme published as a package:

```sh
npx @chakra-ui/cli tokens <@your-org/chakra-theme-package>
```

A published theme package should export a theme object as either the `default`
export or an export named `theme`.

```jsx
// chakra-theme-package/src/index.js
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

const theme = extendTheme({})

// as default export
export default theme
// as named export
export { theme }
```

### Changed

## [1.6.3](./#1.6.3) - 2021-05-26

### Fixed

**System**

- Fixed boolean condition affecting `bgImage` url

### Added

**Popper**

Add `enabled` option to `usePopper` hook. The `popper.js` instance will not be
created until this option is `true`.

`Menu`, `Popover` and `Tooltip` components now use this option, so the
`popper.js` instance is created only once the popper is open. This should
significantly improve render and scroll performance.

> Affect components: `Popover`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`

### Changed

## [1.6.2](./#1.6.2) - 2022-05-17

### Fixed

**Form Control**

- Fix issue where `FormLabel` could not be used without form-control

**Menu**

- Fix issue where keyboard navigation doesn't work `isLazy` is passed.
- Fix issue where typeaheaad overrides input keydown

**NumberInput**

- Fix warning with scroll listener when `allowMouseWheel` is passed

**Radio**

- Fix issue where `Radio` or `useRadio` gets non-unique id when wrapped within
  `FormControl`.

**Transition**

- Fix issue where `onAnimationComplete` is not forwarded to motion element

**Gatsby Plugin**

- Pass `pluginOptions` correctly to the `ChakraProvider`. Fixes

### Added

**ChakraProvider**

- `ChakraProvider` now accepts the prop `cssVarsRoot` which defaults to
  `:host, :root`.

**System**

- Add support for ring style props

Added ring style props to make it easier to style an element's focus ring
shadows. Props are `ring`, `ringColor`, `ringOffset`, and `ringOffsetColor`.

```jsx live=false
// adds a 2px box-shadow with `gray.400` color
<Box ring="2px" ringColor="gray.400">
  Sample
</Box>

// adds main box-shadow + offset box-shadow
<Box ring="2px" ringColor="gray.400" ringOffset="3px" ringOffsetColor="white">
 Sample
</Box>
```

- Add support for filter style props

Added css variable based API to apply css filter properties (blur,
backdrop-blur) to an element. Props are `filter`, `blur`, `sepia`, `brightness`,
`invert`, `saturation`, `backdropFilter`, `backdropBlur`, `sepia`, `saturation`,
etc.

To use this API, you'll need to set `filter` to `auto`, same for
`backdropFilter`.

```jsx live=false
// adds a 3px blur filter to this element
<Image src="boruto.png" filter="auto" blur="3px" />

// adds a 3px blur and 40% saturation filter to this element
<Image src="boruto.png" filter="auto" blur="3px" saturation={0.4} />
```

- Add support for transform styles

Added css variable based API to apply css transform properties (translateX,
translateY, scale, etc.). Props are `translateX`, `translateY`, `rotate`,
`scaleX`, `scaleY`, and `scale`.

To use this API, you'll need to set `transform` to `auto` or `auto-gpu` (for the
GPU accelerated version).

```jsx live=false
<Circle transform="auto" translateX="4" _hover={{ translateX: "8" }}>
  <CheckIcon />
</Circle>
```

- Add `mixBlendMode`, `backgroundBlendMode`, and `bgBlendMode` props to apply
  blend modes to elements

- Automatic wrapping of `backgroundImage` or `bgImage` props with `url()` so you
  can just pass the image URL directly.

```jsx live=false
// You can now do this!
<Box bgImage="naruto.png" />

// This still works
<Box bgImage="url(naruto.png)" />
```

- text decoration styles: Added `textDecorationColor`, `textDecorationLine`,
  `textDecorationStyles` style props.

- Add `isolation` style prop to create a new stacking context.

- Add support for High Contrast Mode

- Fixed issue where setting `outline:0` or `outline:none` and using `box-shadow`
  for focus outlines don't work in high-contrast mode. To fix this, we've added
  `outline: 2px solid transparent` whenever you set `outline:0` to make your
  components work in high-constrast mode by default.
  [Learn more](https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/whcm-quick-tips/)

- Fix the `_dark` pseudo props to map to
  `.chakra-ui-dark &, [data-theme=dark] &, &[data-theme=dark]`.

- Added `_light` pseudo props to map to
  `.chakra-ui-light &, [data-theme=light] &, &[data-theme=light]` for users that
  prefer to start with dark mode.

- Added `overscroll`, `overscrollX`, and `overscrollY` style prop to manage
  overscroll behavior of an container

**Theme**

- Add blur token values for `filter` and `backdropFilter`

```json
{
  "none": 0,
  "sm": "4px",
  "base": "8px",
  "md": "12px",
  "lg": "16px",
  "xl": "24px",
  "2xl": "40px",
  "3xl": "64px"
}
```

### Changed

**ChakraProvider**

- Attach CSS vars to `:host, :root` to fix usage in shadow dom.

## [1.6.1](./#1.6.1) - 2021-05-05

### Fixed

**Slider**

- Fix issue where `onChangeStart` doesnt get called
- Fix issue where slider thumb remains tabbable when `isDisabled={true}`
- Fix issue where `onChangeEnd` doesn't get called when you click anywhere on
  the track

**CLI**

- Fixes issues with `tokens` command hanging forever if theme workers run into
  errors during runtime.

  Now when an error is discovered within a worker an `{ err: string }` object is
  passed to the parent which will cause the promise to reject.

  This will in turn, pass the same `err` upwards to allow the command to exit
  gracefully, printing the `err` in question to `stdout`

### Added

**Popover**

- Add an export for `usePopoverContext` hook

**Transition**

- Add support for tweaking the enter-exit transitions.

  > Affected components: `Fade`, `Slide`, `SlideFade`, `SlideScale`, `Collapse`

```jsx live=false
<Fade
  transition={{
    enter: { duration: 0.3 },
    exit: { duration: 0.1 },
  }}
/>
```

- Fix issue where `Collapse` animation hide overflow when it expands.

> Collapse transition how shows overflow when it's expanded and hides overflow
> when it's collapsed.

- Add support for `delay` prop for all transition components.

```jsx live=false
// as a number
<Fade delay={0.3} />

// or based on state (enter/exit only)
<Fade delay={{ enter: 0.2 }} />

// or both
<Fade delay={{ enter: 0.2, exit: 0.1 }} />
```

> Note: this only works when you're using our built-in transition definition. If
> you're passing your own transition definition, pass the delay there.

```jsx live=false
// adding delay to your custom transition definition
<Fade
  transition={{
    enter: { duration: 0.2, delay: 0.1 },
  }}
/>
```

### Changed

## [1.6.0](./#1.6.0) - 2021-04-23

### Fixed

**Tabs**

- Fix issue where keyboard navigation does not work correctly for RTL layouts

### Added

**System**

Add new `extendTheme` function that allows you to pass multiple overrides or
extensions:

```js live=false
import {
  extendTheme,
  withDefaultColorScheme,
  withDefaultSize,
  withDefaultVariant,
  withDefaultProps,
} from "@chakra-ui/react"

const customTheme = extendTheme(
  {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        // ...
        500: "#b4d455",
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
  withDefaultColorScheme({ colorScheme: "brand" }),
  withDefaultSize({
    size: "lg",
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  withDefaultVariant({
    variant: "outline",
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  // or all in one:
  withDefaultProps({
    defaultProps: {
      colorScheme: "brand",
      variant: "outline",
      size: "lg",
    },
    components: ["Input", "NumberInput", "PinInput"],
  }),
  // optional:
  yourCustomBaseTheme, // defaults to our chakra default theme
)
```

### Changed

**Gatsby Plugin**

Upgrading to this new major version is recommended for everyone as it fixes hot
reloading in Gatsby (Fast Refresh). In the previous version changes to the
shadowed `theme.js` file didn't trigger automatic reloading, and a manual reload
was necessary.

Breaking Changes

- The `isUsingColorMode` option was removed. The `ChakraProvider` will always
  use the `ColorModeProvider`
- The `isResettingCSS` option was renamed to `resetCSS`

Improvements

- Use `ChakraProvider` instead of the outdated `ThemeProvider` pattern
- Add `initialColorMode` to the `ColorModeScript`
- Allow Fast Refresh reloading of all theme files
- Set stricter `peerDependency` on `gatsby` (to `^2.29.3 || ^3.0.0`)

## [1.5.2](./#1.5.2) - 2021-04-19

### Fixed

**Modal**

- Fixed an issue where the modal exceeded the viewport height on iOS

**Slider**

- Fix issue where slider doesnt work after first slide
- Avoid exccess onChange calls

**Stat**

- Fixed a11y issue related to `StatHelpText`. It was using an invalid `dl` child
  tag.

**System**

- Fixed an issue where the transition props are not resolved correctly

### Added

**Button**

- Added `spinnerPlacement` prop to allow changing the spinner placement for the
  button when `isLoading` is `true`. Spinner placement can be either `start` or
  `end`

```jsx live=false
<Button isLoading spinnerPlacement="end">
  Click me
</Button>
```

**Checkbox**

- Add `isDisabled` prop to `CheckboxGroup`

### Changed

**Menu, Popover, Tabs**

- Revert the behavior of the `isLazy` prop (which was broken by the previous
  release) and adds a new `lazyBehavior` prop which configures the behavior of
  `isLazy`.

  If you'd like the content of tab panel, popover and menu components to be
  unmounted when not selected or opened, please continue to use `isLazy`. This
  is the default behavior.

  If you'd like the content of tab panel, popover and menu components to remain
  mounted (but hidden) after it was previously selected or opened, use
  `lazyBehavior="keepMounted"` in combination with `isLazy`.

**Menu, Popover**

- Make it possible to pass popper.js props to popover and menu

## [1.5.1](./#1.5.1) - 2021-04-13

### Fixed

**List**

- Fix RTL styles for `OrderedList` and `UnorderedList`

**Progress**

- Fix an issue where `CircularProgress` with `isIndeterminate` doesn't show the
  indicator

**System**

- Fixed typing issues for `extendTheme` where variant overrides lead to an TS
  error.

**Spinner**

- Fix issue where spinner base-style cant be overriden

### Added

**Menu**

- Add `closeOnSelect` to `MenuItem` and `MenuItemOption`.

  This allows menu items to override their parent `Menu`'s `closeOnSelect`
  behavior.

  Can be useful for menus with a combination of `MenuItem`s (that generally
  close their menu when selected) and `MenuItemOption`s (that should keep the
  menu open for further edition).

- Fix issue where menu unmounts after first render

**Environment**

- Add `EnvironmentProvider` to `ChakraProvider` for better window and document
  detection across hooks and components

**System**

- Allow passing custom props to `useStyleConfig` hook

### Changed

**Tabs**

- Do not unmount lazy tabs when unselected

**Theme**

- Changes incorrect `panel` part name in `Progress` theme file to `label`
- Update input, alert and tabs RTL styles

## [1.5.0](./#1.5.0) - 2021-04-07

### Fixed

### Added

**Table**

- Add `TableContainer` component to help tables scroll horizontally when
  overflowing.

```jsx live=false
<TableContainer>
    <Table>{...}</Table>
</TableContainer>
```

### Changed

**Popover**

- Return prop getters for popover header and body and use `ref` callback to
  determine element's presense instead of `useEffect`.
- Mark `usePopover` as internal for now.
- Add popover arrow shadow color prop.
- Add support for `rootProps` to `PopoverContent` to allow passing props to
  popover's positioner.
- Make it possible to add custom motion `variants` so users can orchestrate
  custom transitions.
- Move popover arrow shadow color computation to popover's theme.
- Moved `maxW` from popover's `popper` to `content` to allow for better control
  of the popover's width.
- Use `width` instead of `maxW` to allow users more control of popover's width
- Use `--popover-bg` css property to control popover and arrow background.

```jsx live=false
<PopoverContent style={{ "--popover-bg": "purple" }}>
  <PopoverArrow />
</PopoverContent>
```

**Select**

- Update select icon to use `insetEnd` instead of `right` for RTL.

**Skip Link**

- Update styles to use `insetStart` instead of `left` for RTL.

**Table**

- Update text align attribute to use `end` instead of `right` for RTL.

## [1.4.2](./#1.4.2) - 2021-03-30

### Fixed

**Hooks**

- `useControllableState`: The `onChange` callback will be called only if the new
  value isn't equal to the current one.`

**Stack**

- Fix bug where a margin bottom would get applied to direction=row of stack

**AbsoluteCenter**

- Fix issue where element doesn't have `position: absolute`

**NumberInput**

- Forward `aria-*` props to the input element.
- Fix issue where `onChange` was called on mount.
- Fix issue where `onBlur` was called twice.
- Memoize all callback props `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `getAriaValueText`
- Refactor implicit `useFormControl` logic to be called from `NumberInput`
  instead.
- Call `setFocused.on` with `ReactDOM.flushSync` to prevent concurrent mode
  issue where setting state in `onFocus` affects `onChange` event handler.

### Added

**Form Control**

- Added `useFormControl` hook that returns prop getters `getHelpTextProps`,
  `getErrorMessageProps`, and `getRootProps`. This will make it easier to
  integrate with number-input, checkbox, and switch.
- Fix concurrent mode issue with setting state in focus event handler. We use
  `withFlushSync` helper to achieve this.

**System**

- Add support for css variable tokens. This means you can create a css variable
  and reference value in the tokens.

```jsx
// We're convert `colors.red.200` to `var(--chakra-colors-red-200)`
<Box
  sx={{
    "--banner-color": "colors.red.200",
    "& .banner": {
      bg: "var(--banner-color)",
    },
  }}
/>
```

You can also add fallback values in event the token doesn't exist:

```jsx
<Box
  sx={{
    // evaluates to #fff if `colors.red.1000` doesn't exists in theme map
    "--banner-color": "colors.red.1000, #fff",
    "& .banner": {
      bg: "var(--banner-color)",
    },
  }}
/>
```

This opens new possbilities with css variables, for example you can apply
responsive token values like you would with style props.

> TypeScript support for this is still WIP

```jsx
<Box
  sx={{
    "--banner-color": ["colors.red.200", "colors.pink.400"],
    "& .banner": {
      bg: "var(--banner-color)",
    },
  }}
/>
```

- Add support for `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `scaleX`, `scaleY` style props.

### Changed

**Theme**

- Remove `0` token value from spacing tokens. 0 maps to `0` and there's no need
  to create a css custom property for that.

## [1.4.1](./#1.4.1) - 2021-03-21

### Fixed

**System** :Avoid mutation for `getWithPriority` to get `textStyle` and
`layerStyle` working consistently.

### Added

### Changed

## [1.4.0](./#1.4.0) - 2021-03-21

### Fixed

**All Components**

- Added support for `framer-motion` v4

**System**

- Fix issue where responsive styles defined in textstyles not overriden wiht
  props.
- Fix issue where `toCSSVars` omitted the transition tokens
- Fix issue where RTL property keys are incorrect due to `config.property`
  mutation.
- Change `mx` and `px` to use logical properties. Instead of mapping to
  `marginLeft` and `marginRight`, it maps to `marginInlineStart` and
  `marginInlineEnd`. Same for `px`

**Radio**

- Fix issue where controlled radio group can't be cleared
- Fix: `onChange` type for `use-radio-group` props

**Tag**

- Add `aria-label` to tag close button
- Fix issue where `TagLeftIcon` and `TagRightIcon` doesn't work for RTL layouts.

### Added

**Hooks**

- Add new `usePointerEvent` hook to unify pointer event management
- Added `useFocusOnPointerDown` to get Safari to detect the correct
  `event.relatedTarget` when you blur a focused element.

**CLI**

- Add support for `textStyle` and `layerStyle` theme type generation to
  `@chakra-ui/cli`

**System**

- Add support for `textStyle` and `layerStyle` theme type generation to
  `@chakra-ui/cli`

**Theme**

- Add `root` to parts to `NumberInput` theme, leverage css variables and update
  styles to be rtl friendly.

### Changed

**Popper (Breaking)**

- Refactor the positioning logic to improve stability and leverage CSS custom
  properties

- Refactor arrow components to use `data-popper-arrow` and
  `data-popper-arrow-inner` to define the arrow elements. This is used within
  the modifiers to update the arrow styles/position positioning.

- Change `arrowSize` and `arrowShadowColor` to use CSS custom properties instead
  of passing it to `usePopper`.

- Update component themes to use `--popper-arrow-bg` to set the background for
  the popper's arrow element.

## [1.3.4](./#1.3.4) - 2021-03-05

### Fixed

**All Components**

- Fixed an issue where extending the theme with custom breakpoints with
  `strictNullChecks: false` in `tsconfig.json` lead to an error.

**Tabs**

- `TabPanels` component can now be styled from `Tabs` component theme,
  specifying the `tabpanels` part.

**Theme**

- Fix full size modal with y-overflowing content behaviour
- Fix border styles for alert and number input
- Resolved an issue where `optgroup` in dark mode was unreadable on browsers
  that allow `select` contents styling.

**Popper**

- Ensure the react-popper state in sync with the internal popper instance state

### Added

**System**

- Improve style computation performance by 2.5x by converting all theme tokens
  to CSS variables. This also makes it possible to reference theme tokens in
  vanilla CSS as well.

- Add new config property `cssVarPrefix` to add a custom prefix for CSS
  variables. It defaults to `chakra`.

- Adds support for `main` element in chakra factory

### Changed

## [1.3.3](./#1.3.3) - 2021-02-13

### Fixed

**Popper**

- Fix issue where Popper.js instance was re-created too frequently. It is now
  created only once it is actually needed for positioning.

**CLI**

- The `tokens` command now ignores TS errors in your theme.ts file

### Added

**Color Mode**

- Add support for customizing the `nonce` of the `<script>` that
  `ColorModeScript` creates by passing `nonce` prop.

### Changed

**Checkbox, Radio**

- Improve the semantic HTML structure of checkbox. `label` is a phrasing content
  element and should not contain block element `div`.
- Replaced `div` with `span` which is an inline element.

**Focus Lock**: Upgrade to `react-remove-scroll@2.4.1` and
`react-focus-lock@2.5.0` to fix React 17 peer dependencies compatibility

**System**

- The `extendTheme` function uses the type `Theme` again
- Fix an issue where TypeScript did not allow custom breakpoint names in
  ResponsiveObject

---

## [1.3.2](./#1.3.2) - 2021-02-06

### Fixed

- **System**: Fixed an issue where the types for component `defaultProps` and
  `ComponentMultiStyleConfig` were too narrow.

### Added

### Changed

## [1.3.1](./#1.3.1) - 2021-02-06

### Fixed

**System**: Fix issue wher typings for `size` and `variant` for `AvatarGroup`,
`CheckboxGroup`, `ButtonGroup`, and `RadioGroup` were incorrect.

### Added

### Changed

## [1.3.0](./#1.3.0) - 2021-02-06

### Fixed

**PinInput**

Resolved an issue where completing character entry in `PinInput` failed to call
`onComplete`.

**System**

- Fixed issue in `extendTheme` where overrides defined as function replaced all
  base styles defined as plain object.

- Allow numbers for `borderTop` and provide autocomplete for `fontWeight` prop

**Tooltip**

- Fixed an issue where a `Tooltip` with negative `gutter` causes flickering on
  hover.

### Added

**System**

- Introduce generic type `ChakraTheme` to improve the `extendTheme` function
  even further

```ts
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export const customTheme = extendTheme({
  // here you get autocomplete for
  //   - existing definitions from the default theme
  //   - new components (Single and MultiStyle)
  //   - CSS definitions
  //   - color hues
  //   - etc.
})

export type MyCustomTheme = typeof customTheme
```

You can get typesafe access to your custom theme like this:

```ts
import { useTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
import { MyCustomTheme } from "./my-custom-theme"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const customTheme = useTheme<MyCustomTheme>()
  //...
}
```

- Add support for `textStyle` and `layerStyle` in styled-system package. This
  makes it possible to use them in the component theme, `css` function, and `sx`
  prop as well.

```jsx
const theme = {
  textStyles: {
    caps: {
      fontWeight: "bold",
      fontSize: "24px",
    },
  },
}

const styles = css({ textStyle: "caps" })(theme)
```

This also works for component theme as well.

> `layerStyle`, `textStyle` and `apply` can now take responsive values as well.

- Refactored `apply` prop handling to use the style config pattern instead of
  add it imperatively.

### Changed

## [1.2.1](./#1.2.1) - 2021-01-31

### Fixed

**System**: Allow `string` values for `ThemingProps['colorScheme']`

### Added

**CLI**: Add support for `tokens` command to generate theme typings.

### Changed

## [1.2.0](./#1.2.0) - 2021-01-20

### Fixed

**AbsoluteCenter**: Fix issue where style was incorrect when when `axis` is
`both`

**NumberInput**: Fix issue where blurring `NumberInputField` did not clamp the
value using the `precision` prop

### Added

**Styled System**

- Improved theme typing in order to provide a better autocomplete experience
- Fixed a type issue where pseudo style props like `_hover` and `_active` didn't
  allow standard CSS properties

**Stack**: Add `shouldWrapChildren` to `Wrap` component to make it possible use
`Wrap` directly without thinking about `WrapItem`.

**Menu**

- Add support `rootProps` to `MenuList` so it's possible override the styles for
  root container for menu list. Common use case is to change the applied
  `zIndex` of the menulist.
- Make it possible to override `zIndex` by passing props to `MenuList`
- The `MenuItem` now accepts a `commandSpacing` prop that can be used to adjust
  the space between the command and label.

**Portal**

- Add support for changing the container that portal is appended to. You can now
  pass `containerRef` to portal.
- Add support for `appendToParentPortal={false}` to opt out of nested portals.
- Fix issue with portal `zIndex` container where it renders elements outside of
  view.
- Renamed `getContainer` prop to `containerRef` to make it possible to pass the
  `ref` directly. This affects the `Modal` component primarily

```jsx live=false
// Before
<Portal getContainer={() => ref.current}>{/** Content */}</Portal>

// After
<Portal containerRef={ref}>{/** Content */}</Portal>
```

**Modal, Tooltip**

Add support for forwarding props to the underlying `Portal` component. Pass the
`portalProps` prop to achive this. The 2 props you can pass to the portalProps
are:

- `containerRef`: `ref` for the element where to mount the portal
- `appendToParentPortal`: If `false`, it'll opt out of portal nesting

```jsx
<Modal portalProps={{ containerRef: ref }}>
  <ModalOverlay />
  <ModalContent>
    <Box>Modal content</Box>
    <Tooltip portalProps={{ appendToParentPortal: false }}>
      Some tooltip
    </Tooltip>
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>
```

### Changed

**Color Mode**: `useColorModeValue` defaults to light mode on first render if
system color mode is used.

**Hooks**: Update `useOutsideClick` reference to use the correct owner document
