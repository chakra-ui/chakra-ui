### Minor Changes

- [#4991](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/4991)
  [`6095eaf9a`](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commit/6095eaf9ac64a7e4d9f934bcb530bae2a92111a6)
  Thanks [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - Update build system
  we use from a custom babel cli setup to
  [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

  The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
  and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges
  all files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

  **Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you
  imported any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach
  like
  `import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
  you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

  Here's how to resolve it:

  ```jsx live=false
  // Won't work ðŸŽ‡
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

  // Works âœ…
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
  ```

  If this affected your project, we recommend that you import hooks, functions
  or components the way it's shown in the documentation. This will help keep
  your project future-proof.

  behavior priority in the following order:

  - if `useSystemColorMode` is true system-color will be used as default -
    initial colormode is the fallback if system color mode isn't resolved

  - if `--chakra-ui-color-mode` is defined through e.g. `ColorModeScript` this
    will be used

  - if `colorModeManager` = `localStorage` and a value is defined for
    `chakra-ui-color-mode` this will be used

  - if `initialColorMode` = `system` system-color will be used as default -
    initial colormode is the fallback if system color mode isn't resolved

  - if `initialColorMode` = `'light'|'dark'` the corresponding value will be
    used

  [`6095eaf9a`](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commit/6095eaf9ac64a7e4d9f934bcb530bae2a92111a6)
  Thanks [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - Update build system
  we use from a custom babel cli setup to
  [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

  The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
  and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges
  all files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

  **Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you
  imported any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach
  like
  `import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
  you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

  Here's how to resolve it:

  ```jsx live=false
  // Won't work ðŸŽ‡
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

  // Works âœ…
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
  ```

  If this affected your project, we recommend that you import hooks, functions
  or components the way it's shown in the documentation. This will help keep
  your project future-proof.

  Thanks [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - Update build system
  we use from a custom babel cli setup to
  [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

  The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
  and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges
  all files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

  **Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you
  imported any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach
  like
  `import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
  you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

  Here's how to resolve it:

  ```jsx live=false
  // Won't work ðŸŽ‡
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

  // Works âœ…

  Thanks [@jesstelford](https://github.com/jesstelford)! -
  `react-focus-lock@2.5.1` includes a dependency update of `focus-lock` from
  `0.8.1` -> `0.9.1`. The change in `focus-lock` includes a fix for performance
  in JSDOM:
  [https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock/pull/24](https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock/pull/24)

  JSDOM is used when testing react components in jest and other unit testing
  frameworks. In particular, when used with `@testing-library/react` for
  simulating real user input.

  Locally tested on an Apple M1 Air using a moderately complex `<Modal>`
  component (which contained inputs, `react-hook-form` usage, etc). Before this
  change: 20,149ms After this change: 2,347ms

  Approx. 10x performance increase.

  [`6095eaf9a`](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/commit/6095eaf9ac64a7e4d9f934bcb530bae2a92111a6)
  Thanks [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - Update build system
  we use from a custom babel cli setup to
  [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

  The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
  and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges
  all files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

  **Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you
  imported any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach
  like
  `import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
  you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

  Here's how to resolve it:

  ```jsx live=false
  // Won't work ðŸŽ‡
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

  // Works âœ…
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
  ```

  If this affected your project, we recommend that you import hooks, functions
  or components the way it's shown in the documentation. This will help keep
  your project future-proof.

  Thanks [@segunadebayo](https://github.com/segunadebayo)! - Update build system
  we use from a custom babel cli setup to
  [preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/).

  The previous build system transpiles the code in `src` directory to `dist/esm`
  and `dist/cjs` keeping the same file structure. The new build system merges
  all files in `src` and transpiles to a single `esm` and `cjs` file.

  **Potential Breaking Change:** The side effect of this is that, if you
  imported any function, component or hook using the **undocumented** approach
  like
  `import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"`,
  you'll notice that the this doesn't work anymore.

  Here's how to resolve it:

  ```jsx live=false
  // Won't work ðŸŽ‡
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks/dist/use-outside-click"

  // Works âœ…
  import { useOutsideClick } from "@chakra-ui/hooks"
  ```

  If this affected your project, we recommend that you import hooks, functions
  or components the way it's shown in the documentation. This will help keep
  your project future-proof.
