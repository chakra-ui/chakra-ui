## Minor Changes

### Progress `2.1.0`

- Added support for overriding the `role` for `Progress` eleement. This makes it
  possible to use the progress as a meter element.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Progress size="sm" value={20} role="meter" aria-label="Usage" />
  ```

## Patch Changes

### Progress `2.1.0`

- Fixed accessibility issue where the `title` prop was not passed to the
  underlying `role=progress` element.

### Checkbox `2.2.3`

- Replaced `framer-motion` with native css animation

### CSS Reset `2.0.9`

- Use `dvh` unit if supported

  This allows the user agent to dynamically adapt the height of a Modal,
  depending on what parts of the UI (e.g. address bar) are visible.

### Editable `2.0.14`

- Fixed issue where `onSubmit` was called twice when input is blurred with enter
  key.

### Theme `2.1.15`

- Replaced `mode` runtime function with CSS variables where possible.

### Visually Hidden `2.0.12`

- Removed unneeded units for zero values `0px -> 0`

### UseFocusEffect `2.0.6`

- Fixed issue where focus sometimes moved back to the open element when it was
  intentionally moved away from it.

### Hooks `2.1.1`

- Fixed issue where focus sometimes moved back to the open element when it was
  intentionally moved away from it.
