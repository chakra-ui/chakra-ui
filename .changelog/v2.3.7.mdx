### Minor Changes

#### @chakra-ui/progress@2.1.0:

- Add support for overriding the `role` for `Progress` eleement. This makes it
  possible to use the progress as a meter element.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Progress size="sm" value={20} role="meter" aria-label="Usage" />
  ```

### Patch Changes

#### @chakra-ui/progress@2.1.0:

- Fix accessibility issue where the `title` prop was not passed to the
  underlying `role=progress` element.

#### @chakra-ui/checkbox@2.2.3:

- Replaced `framer-motion` with css animation

#### @chakra-ui/css-reset@2.0.9:

- fix(css-reset): Use dvh unit if supported

  This allows the user agent to dynamically adapt the height of a Modal,
  depending on what parts of the UI (e.g. address bar) are visible.

#### @chakra-ui/editable@2.0.14:

- Fix issue where `onSubmit` was called twice when input is blurred with enter
  key.

#### @chakra-ui/theme@2.1.15:

- Replace using JS runtime function in the theme to CSS variables. This removed
  the need for the `mode` function in most components.

#### @chakra-ui/visually-hidden@2.0.12:

- Removed unneeded units for zero values `0px -> 0`

#### @chakra-ui/react-use-focus-effect@2.0.6, @chakra-ui/hooks@2.1.1:

- Fixed issue where focus sometimes moved back to the open element when it was
  intentionally moved away from it.
