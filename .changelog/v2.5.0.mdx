## New Release

### Next.js `2.0.1`

Introducing a new Next.js integration package that provides a smoother
experience when using Chakra UI in your Next.js 13 apps.

> Note: This package is optional, you don't have to use it. It's just a
> convenience package aimed that improving developer experience with Next.js

This package provides 2 main features:

- **CacheProvider**: This component composes the Emotion.js' cache provider with
  the `useServerInsertedHTML` hook from `next/navigation`.

  This is necessary to ensure that computed styles are included in the initial
  server payload (during streaming).

  The `use client` directive is still required to be added to the top of the
  page-related file. This is a limitation of CSS-in-JS libraries and Emotion for
  now.

  > Note: Make sure to include the `<head>` tag in your layout component
  > otherwise it will not work.

  ```jsx live=false
  // app/layout.tsx
  "use client"
  import { CacheProvider } from "Next-js"
  import { ChakraProvider } from "React"

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode,
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <head />
        <body>
          <CacheProvider>
            <ChakraProvider>{children}</ChakraProvider>
          </CacheProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    )
  }
  ```

- **Link**: This component combines the functionality of the Next.js `Link` and
  Chakra UI `Link` components.

```jsx live=false
// app/page.tsx
"use client"
import { Link } from "Next-js"

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about" color="blue.400" _hover={{ color: "blue.500" }}>
      About
    </Link>
  )
}
```

> Support for `next/image` coming soon!

## Minor Changes

### Styled System `2.6.0`

Add `hideFrom` and `hideBelow` style props to styled system. This allows more
control over when to show/hide elements without requiring explicit
`display: none` every time.

```jsx live=false
<Box hideFrom="md">I will be hidden from md breakpoint up</Box>
<Box hideBelow="md">I will be hidden from md breakpoint down</Box>
```

## Patch Changes

### Styled System `2.6.0`

- Remove experimental style props `experimental_spaceX` and
  `experimental_spaceY`

- Update the regex of `parseGradient` to make it works on legacy Firefox
  browser.

- Updated dependencies

### Accordion `2.1.9`

Fix regression where `ExpandedIndex` was no longer exported.

> Note: this will be removed in future versions.

### Avatar `2.2.5`

**AvatarGroup**: Fixed issue where setting `max` to `0` lead to unexpected
behavior.

### Input `2.0.20`

Added `data-group` attribute to `InputGroup` component.

This will allow uniform styling changes for `Input`, `InputElement`, and
`InputAddon` to occur when detecting state changes such as `:hover` and
`:focus-within`.

### Menu `2.1.9`

Fix issue where `Menu` schedules focus too frequently and leads to infinite
rerenders.

### Skeleton `2.0.24`

Fix regression where `SkeletonText` component doesn't show its shimmer
animation.

## useSize `2.0.9`

Update dependency `@zag-js/element-size` to `v0.3.1`

## Hooks `2.1.6`

**useClipboard**: Improve reactivity by ensuring it uses the latest reference of
the passed `value`

## Breakpoint Utils `2.0.8`

Add `get` method to breakpoint return to query details of a specific breakpoint
