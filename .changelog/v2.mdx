## [2.8.2](./#2.8.2) - 2023-11-09

### Fixed

**Alert**

- Set the standard color for toasts and alerts to a slightly darker color to
  make i WCAG compatible

**Anatomy**

- Add missing stepper anatomy parts

**Next.js**

- Add `isExternal` to types

**Styled System**

- Fixed a bug where `hueRotate` and `backdropHueRotate` were not working.

**Toast**

- Unique aria-labels for toast-manager divs

**Tooltip**

- Don't track tooltip scroll parent when `closeOnScroll` is not set

### Added

**Form Control**

- Allow theming FormControl through state style props and its children through
  \_group\* style props

### Changed

**Storybook Addon**

- Bumps Storybook deps to latest (7.5.3) and updates the tooling

  - Toggling state for color mode originally used Storybook's `useAddonState`
    api hook. However, this hook is not reliable to persistent allow toggling of
    boolean state. Replaces this hook with React's `useState` as this state is a
    primitive.
  - Makes use of the `makeDecorator` function to make this addon more like an
    official Storybook addon.
  - Removes unneeded props from the button components that were originally part
    of a Type error bug.

## [2.8.1](./#2.8.1) - 2023-09-08

### Fixed

**Hooks**

- Fix issue with use client directive in next.js

**Menu**

- Fix issue where menu item causes page scroll unneccessarily

**Tabs**

- Distored UI when device orientation or width is changed - On changing the
  device width and change of device orientation, the tab indicator element which
  is position absolute aligns realtive to the outer container element.

  Hence, the position of immediate parent(tabs) is set to relative in this fix.
  This makes sure, if the orientation changes the tab indicator is aligned
  relative to its parent.

**Theme**

- Fix issue where `zIndex` of DrawerOverlay creates incorrect stacking order
  when multiple drawers are used.

### Added

**Modal**

- Added "slideInTop" and "slideInLeft" options in `motionPreset` prop in modal
  component

### Changed

**CSS Reset, Icon, Theme, VisuallyHidden (potential breaking)**

- **(POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE)** Remove export defaults and favor of named
  exports.

  ```diff
  - import theme from "@chakra-ui/theme"
  + import { theme } from "@chakra-ui/theme"
  ```

  ```diff
  - import Icon from "@chakra-ui/icon"
  + import { Icon } from "@chakra-ui/icon"
  ```

  ```diff
  - import CSSReset from "@chakra-ui/css-reset"
  + import { CSSReset } from "@chakra-ui/css-reset"
  ```

  ```diff
  - import VisuallyHidden from "@chakra-ui/visually-hidden"
  + import { VisuallyHidden } from "@chakra-ui/visually-hidden"
  ```

**Anatomy, Theme, Theme Tools**

- Remove "use client" directive since they are pure JS packages.

## [2.8.0](./#2.8.0) - 2023-07-18

### Fixed

**All components**

- To improve support for the App Router, all components and hooks are exported
  with the `"use client"` directive.

**Avatar**

- Pass referrerPolicy to AvatarImage instead of keeping it on the parent span

**Checkbox**

- Fix issue where switch thumb state can't be styled with pseudo props.
- Use addEventListener for form resets instead of overriding the onreset form
  function.

**Input**

- Fix `InputElement` and `InputAddon` sizing when using a responsive `size`
  value for `InputGroup`.

  _Note: this requires changes in the latest **@chakra-ui/theme** or, for custom
  themes, sizes to be driven with CSS variables. See the
  [default theme](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/main/packages/components/theme/src/components/input.ts)
  for an example._

**Media Query**

- Support `null` value in `useBreakpointValue` hook

**Menu, Theme**

- Allow styling `MenuIcon` as part of `Menu` theme

**Next.js**

- Fix issue where DOM image props are not forwarded to Image component

**Switch**

- Fix issue where switch thumb state can't be styled with pseudo props.

**Storybook Addon**

- Improve build and exports

  - Export a `preview` object containing the provider decorator
  - Modify tsup config for improved build and to generate `.dts` files for prod
  - Use up-to-date decorator function type for Provider decorator
    - Turns the first argument for the story into a function which returns the
      preview.

**Toast**

- Fix issue where toast provider region doesn't have a label

**Tooltip**

- Fix tooltip prevent onClose to get fired on tooltip opened

### Added

**Anatomy**

- Add `group` part to `inputAnatomy`
- Allow styling `MenuIcon` as part of `Menu` theme

### Changed

**Popover**

- Clarify the usage of `openDelay` and `closeDelay` properties of `Popover`
  component

**Tabs**

- Updates the `UseTabOptions` interface, potentially affecting code using
  `useTab()` or `<Tab />` components:

  - Removes the following unused fields: `id`, `panelId`, and `isSelected`.
  - Adds the field `isFocusable` which was being directly accessed and used, but
    was not explicitly typed or documented.
  - Adds the default value of `false` for `isDisabled` and `isFocusable`. The
    former was documented as defaulting to `false`, but both were defaulting to
    `undefined`.

  Please review your codebase to ensure compatibility with these changes.

**Theme**

- Move all `Input` size styles to CSS variables and apply them to both the
  `field` part and the new `group` part so that said variables are available to
  both the field and elements/addons within an `InputGroup`.

- Revert `getColorVar` usage to `getColor`

## [2.7.1](./#2.7.1) - 2023-06-19

### Fixed

**React**

- Expose the skip nav components and types to the main package

  ```ts
  import {
    SkipNavLink,
    type SkipNavLinkProps,
    SkipNavContent,
    type SkipNavContentProps,
  } from "@chakra-ui/react"
  ```

### Added

### Fixed

**Accordion**

- Fixed AccordionIconProps failure with 'as' prop

**DOM Utils**

- Fix issue where `closeOnScroll` doesn't work when tooltip trigger's scrolling
  parent is not the root document

**Focus Lock**

- Upgrade `focus-trap` package to fix regression with return focus and initial
  focus ref.

**Layout, React**

- Refactored the `Stack` and `Wrap` components to use the flex gap instead of
  the owl selector `& > * ~ *` for spacing.

  This fixes an issue where you can't use raw text nodes as a child of the
  `Stack` or `Wrap` component.

**Menu**

- Fix issue where keyboard events don't work reliably when a MenuItem contains a
  Dialog or similar interactive element.

**Modal**

- Exports `modalManager` and returns the index of the modal from `useModal` to
  allow creating custom components similar to modals

- Refactor input theme to use css var instead of resolving to raw value

**Theme Tools**

  parent is not the root document

### Added

**All packages**

- Bump emotion version to `11.11.x` to support css cascade layers

**Layout, React**

- Add new `Indicator` layout component. Useful for positioning an element in the
  corners of another element.

  For example, let's say you want to position a notification badge in the top
  end corner of a box. You can use the `Indicator` component to achieve this.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box position="relative" width="80px" height="80px" bg="gray.50">
    <Indicator placement="top-end">
      <Circle size="5" bg="red.100">
        3
      </Circle>
    </Indicator>
  </Box>
  ```

**Next.js**

- Add `isExternal` to Link component

**Provider**

- Add support for disabling global styles via the `disableGlobalStyle` prop on
  the `ChakraProvider`.

  This is useful for scenarios where user needs to scope all global styles + css
  reset to a specific element.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"

  function App() {
    return (
      <ChakraProvider disableGlobalStyle>
        <App />
      </ChakraProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

**Theme**

- Add explicit color attribute on buttons to ensure consistency across light and
  dark modes.

  **ðŸš¨ Potentially Breaking Change ðŸš¨ **

  If your button component code relies on inheriting color on buttons, consider
  adding an explicit color.

### Changed

  component

### Added

**Popover**

- Added support for `shadowColor` prop in the `PopoverArrow` component to change
  the color of the arrow's shadow.

**Stepper**

- Add support for `showLastSeparator` in the `Stepper` component to show the
  last separator in the `Stepper` component. By default, the last separator is
  hidden.

- Add default `chakra-*` classnames to all component parts.

- Expose `activeStepPercent`, `isCompleteStep`, and `isIncompleteStep` to
  `useStep` hook.

- Add `StepIndicatorContent` component to reduce boilerplate for step indicator.

### Changed

## [2.6.0](./#2.6.0) - 2023-04-25

### Fixed

**Avatar**

- Respect `crossOrigin` property in `useImage`

  `isCentered` is set to `true`

**Toast**

- Update element types for toast list and item to apply appropriate
  accessibility roles

**useOutsideClick**

- Fix issue where outside click doesn't get triggered on context menu click
  outside.

### Added

**Stepper**

- Introduce new `Stepper` component to model sequencial steps in a process.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Stepper index={activeStep}>
    {steps.map((step, index) => (
      <Step key={index}>
        <StepIndicator>
          <StepStatus
            complete={<StepIcon />}
            incomplete={<StepNumber />}
            active={<StepNumber />}
          />
        </StepIndicator>

        <Box>
          <StepTitle>{step.title}</StepTitle>
          <StepDescription>{step.description}</StepDescription>
        </Box>

        <StepSeparator />
      </Step>
    ))}
  </Stepper>
  ```

**Editable**

- Adds `finalFocusRef` and `onBlur` to Editable component

**Next.js**

- Add loading props to the `@chakra-ui/next-js`.

**Styled System**

- Add support for native `aspectRatio` style prop

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box aspectRatio="16/9" />
  ```

- Add support for nested semantic tokens in theme. It is now possible to declare
  semantic tokens by nesting objects.

  BEFORE:

  ```js
  const theme = {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        "background.pressed.base": { default: "blue.800", _dark: "blue.300" },
        "background.pressed.subtle": { default: "blue.300", _dark: "blue.700" },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  AFTER:

  ```js
  const theme = {
    semanticTokens: {
      colors: {
        background: {
          pressed: {
            base: { default: "blue.800", _dark: "blue.300" },
            subtle: { default: "blue.300", _dark: "blue.700" },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }
  ```

  This allows for cleaner grouping and organization of tokens.

- Add `_horizontal` and `_vertical` pseudo props to style orientation data
  attributes

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box _horizontal={{ width: "2px" }} _vertical={{ height: "4px" }} />
  ```

**Theme**

- Add semantic tokens for inverse text and subtle text

### Changed

**Gatsby Plugin**

- Reverts the use of the `baseTheme` in the plugin

  With the added features of `extendBaseTheme` and `ChakraBaseProvider`, it was
  determined that the provider is considered unnecessary.

  > Custom theming is to be expected for components when there are no defaults
  > rendered.

  For Gatsby, this means that the plugin can be reverted back to it's original
  setup, and still be able to accept `extendBaseTheme` to reduce the payload of
  the component themes when customizing them.

## [2.5.5](./#2.5.5) - 2023-03-30

### Fixed

**Styled System**

- Fix TS exhaustive issues with v5.0

  `<Hide below="md" />` component

**CSS Reset**

- Fix issue where `<input type="number" />` shows spinner button

**Theme**

- Fix issue where tag outline theme doesn't work as expected.

### Toast `6.1.1`

**Toast**

- Fix issue where zIndex was hardcoded in toast component by providing a css
  variable `--toast-z-index` for better override experience.

  You can set the toast's `zIndex` globally by setting a value for the
  `--toast-z-index`. The default value for this variable is `5500`

  ```jsx live=false
  const theme = extendTheme({
    styles: {
      global: {
        "--toast-z-index": 10,
      },
    },
  })
  ```

**Next.js**

- Fix issue where `fill` prop was not forwarded to the underlying component.

### Added

**Alert**

- Add `data-status` attribute to all alert component parts to allow for better
  finegrained styling

**Styled System**

- Add new `defineCssVars` helper to improve the experience of authoring a set of
  css variables for a component theme.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { defineCssVars } from "@chakra-ui/react"

  // defines the `--badge-bg`, `--badge-border`, and `--badge-size` (with a 1rem fallback)
  const vars = defineCssVars("badge", ["bg", "border", ["size", "1rem"]])

  const style = {
    bg: vars.bg.reference,
    [vars.bg.variable]: "colors.red.500",
    [vars.border.variable]: "colors.red.300",
  }
  ```

### Changed

## [2.5.4](./#2.5.4) - 2023-03-27

### Fixed

**Checkbox, Radio**

- Fix issue where browser shows console warning due to `preventDefault` call in
  pointer event on mobile

**Next.js**

- Fix issue where theming related props (`variant`, `size`) could not be passed
  to the `Link` component

**Tag**

- Fix issue where the tag's base style doesn't set the `--badge-bg` and
  `--badge-color` css variables.

### Added

**Styled System**

- Creates the `gradients` theme key for props `bgGradient`, `bgImage`, `bgImg`,
  and `backgroundImage`

  This addition allows you to use tokens for the gradient values, semantic
  tokens included!

  ```tsx live=false
  // gradients.ts

  export const gradients = {
    lightBgGradient:
      "linear-gradient(102.7deg, #B9F1B9 0%, #5484EA 51.56%, #3A8E89 100%)",
  }

  // SomeComponent.tsx

  <Box bgGradient='lightBgGradient' />
  ```

  ðŸš¨ NOTE: The
  [Background Gradient API](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/gradient#background-gradient-api)
  can not be used in a token as the conversion is done when the api is used
  directly on a prop and not when compiling the theme config

**Toast**

- Add support for the `colorScheme` property in the `useToast` hook

```jsx live=false
const toast = useToast({
  title: "Account created.",
  description: "We've created your account for you.",
  colorScheme: "blue",
})
```

### Changed

## [2.5.3](./#2.5.3) - 2023-03-23

### Fixed

**Form Control**

- Fix issue in `FormLabel` where `htmlFor` and `id` could not be set to `null`

**React Context**

- Fix issue where default value is not passed to the `createContext` function

### Added

**CSS Reset, Provider**

- Add support for scoping the css reset to specific selector.

  To use this feature, pass the `resetScope` prop to the `ChakraProvider` or
  `ChakraBaseProvider` component.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react"

  function App() {
    return (
      <ChakraProvider resetScope=".ck-reset">
        <App />
      </ChakraProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

**Next.js**

- Add `Image` component that supercharges the Next.js optimized image with
  Chakra style props.

```jsx live=false
import { Image } from "@chakra-ui/next-js"

function App() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/image.jpg"
      alt="image"
      width={500}
      height={500}
      objectFit="cover"
    />
  )
}
```

- Add ESM interop for `createCache` to avoid server-related errors

### Changed

**Button**

- Widen types for `loadingText` to accept `ReactNode` instead of only string

## [2.5.2](./#2.5.2) - 2023-03-17

### Fixed

**CSSReset**

- Attach `--chakra-vh` variable to `:host` as well

**Menu**

- Fix issue where `MenuProvider` was not exported

### Added

**Avatar**

- Adding support for Avatar to specify `crossOrigin` prop for image

**Editable**

- Export `useEditableContext` hook

**Styled System**

- Add support for `_firstLetter` pseudo style props which translates to the css
  select `&::first-letter`

  ```jsx live=false
  <Text _firstLetter={{ fontSize: "80px" }}>Hello World</Text>
  ```

### Changed

## [2.5.1](./#2.5.1) - 2023-02-15

- Fix regression where `ExpandedIndex` was no longer exported.

  > Note: this will be removed in future versions.

**Avatar**

- Fixed issue where setting `max` to `0` in `AvatarGroup` lead to unexpected
  behavior.

**Menu**

- Fix issue where `Menu` schedules focus too frequently and leads to infinite
  rerenders.

**Skeleton**

- Fix regression where `SkeletonText` component doesn't show its shimmer
  animation.

**Styled System**

- Update the regex of `parseGradient` to make it works on legacy Firefox
  browser.

**useClipboard**

  `value`

### Added

**Breakpoint Utils**

- Add `get` method to breakpoint return to query details of a specific
  breakpoint

**Input**

- Added `data-group` attribute to `InputGroup` component.

  This will allow uniform styling changes for `Input`, `InputElement`, and
  `InputAddon` to occur when detecting state changes such as `:hover` and
  `:focus-within`.

  Example gif below with a left and right `InputElement`
  ![ezgif com-video-to-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65234762/217900818-cbbbd727-2e75-4523-8563-c90eaac1e69b.gif)

**Next.js** Introducing a new Next.js integration package that provides a
smoother experience when using Chakra UI in your Next.js 13 apps.

> Note: This package is optional, you don't have to use it. It's just a
> convenience package aimed that improving developer experience with Next.js

This package provides 2 main features:

- **CacheProvider**: This component composes the Emotion.js' cache provider with
  the `useServerInsertedHTML` hook from `next/navigation`.

  This is necessary to ensure that computed styles are included in the initial
  server payload (during streaming).

  The `use client` directive is still required to be added to the top of the
  page-related file. This is a limitation of CSS-in-JS libraries and Emotion for
  now.

  > Note: Make sure to include the `<head>` tag in your layout component
  > otherwise it will not work.

  ```jsx live=false
  // app/layout.tsx
  "use client"
  import { CacheProvider } from "Next-js"
  import { ChakraProvider } from "React"

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode,
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <head />
        <body>
          <CacheProvider>
            <ChakraProvider>{children}</ChakraProvider>
          </CacheProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    )
  }
  ```

- **Link**: This component combines the functionality of the Next.js `Link` and
  Chakra UI `Link` components.

```jsx live=false
// app/page.tsx
"use client"
import { Link } from "Next-js"

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Link href="/about" color="blue.400" _hover={{ color: "blue.500" }}>
      About
    </Link>
  )
}
```

> Support for `next/image` coming soon!

**Styled System**

- Add `hideFrom` and `hideBelow` style props to styled system. This allows more
  control over when to show/hide elements without requiring explicit
  `display: none` every time.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Box hideFrom="md">I will be hidden from md breakpoint up</Box>
  <Box hideBelow="md">I will be hidden from md breakpoint down</Box>
  ```

### Changed

**Styled System**

- Remove experimental style props `experimental_spaceX` and
  `experimental_spaceY`

## [2.4.9](./#2.4.9) - 2023-01-16

### Fixed

**All components**

- Improved JS Doc comments to include default values
- Fixed regression in exported components

**Focus Lock**

- Fix ESM interop for `react-focus-lock` and Vitest

### Added

**Provider**

- Add `disableEnvironment` option to disable the environment injected span. The
  environment is used for automatic detection of the `window` and `document`.

```jsx live=false
<ChakraProvider disableEnvironment>
  <App />
</ChakraProvider>
```

### Changed

## [2.4.8](./#2.4.8) - 2023-01-12

### Fixed

**Hooks**

- Fixed issue where `useDimensions` uses stale value of node reference

**Icons**

- Fixed issue where `ReactIcon` was not exported

**Modal**

- Bump `react-remove-scroll`, `react-focus-lock` and `aria-hidden` dependencies
- Fix issue where console throws a warning from react-remove-scroll when
  multiple modal dialogs are open.

**Styled System**

- Fixed issue where `useBreakpointValue` resolves to an incorrect value when
  resizing the window in `Firefox`

**System**

- Fixed issue where TS throws an error when using the `translate` style prop due
  to clash with the native DOM translate attribute.

  This was fixed by omitting the native `translate` attribute and introducing a
  new `htmlTranslate` attribute for user who need this.

**Toast**

- Fixed issue where default toast options are not applied correctly.

### Added

### Changed

**All components**

- Refactor code to use explicit exports

**Theme**

- Refactored `Card` theme to use component tokens. This makes it easier to
  override styles from the base style.

## [2.4.7](./#2.4.7) - 2023-01-11

### Fixed

**Icon**

- Removed duplicate `export * from 'src'` statements

**System**

- Fixed issue where style overrides does not respect order of precedence due to
  the use of `Object.assign`.

  To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

  ```js
  const stylesFromTheme = {
    px: 8,
    padding: 0,
  }

  const stylesFromProps = {
    px: 4,
  }

  const style = Object.assign({}, stylesFromTheme, stylesFromProps)
  // Result: { px: 4, padding: 0 }
  // Expected: { padding: 0, px: 4 }
  ```

  The issue is that `Object.assign` will replace properties in place with values
  from the override objects. This is not the desired behavior for style
  overrides hence a custom `assignAfter` function is used instead

### Added

### Changed

## [2.4.6](./#2.4.6) - 2022-12-29

### Fixed

**All components**

- Fix issues with ESM compatibility by upgrading non-ESM dependencies to their
  latest versions.

**Checkbox, Radio**

- Update `@zag-js/*` dependencies to latest versions for better ESM
  compatibility

- Ensure `InputGroup` isolates its stacking context to prevent z-index clashes

**Theme Tools**

- Fix regression with `lighten` and `darken` functions in theme tools

### Added

**System**

- Add ESM interop for emotion's `styled` default export.

### Changed

## [2.4.5](./#2.4.5) - 2022-12-26

### Fixed

**Storybook addon**

- Fixed issue where color mode and RTL switcher were not working correctly in
  the addon

### Added

### Changed

**All components** Improved the build setup for all packages.

- Switched to the `latest` version of `tsup` for automatic JSX runtime detection

  When set to `true`, the `Skeleton` will take the width of its children.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Skeleton fitContent>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </Skeleton>
  ```

- Export `baseTheme` object with includes only the theme tokens.

**React Types**

- Fixed issue where types were not exported correctly

### Added

**Button**

- Added support for `orientation` prop in the ButtonGroup component.

  This makes it possible to now have vertical button groups when `isAttached` is
  set to `true`.

  ```jsx live=false
  <ButtonGroup isAttached orientation="vertical">
    <Button>Button 1</Button>
    <Button>Button 2</Button>
    <Button>Button 3</Button>
    <Button>Button 4</Button>
  </ButtonGroup>
  ```

**CLI**

- Add the flag `--strict-token-types` for `@chakra-ui/cli tokens` to generate
  strict types for theme tokens (e.g. color, spacing)

  ```bash
  chakra-cli tokens --strict-token-types
  ```

  ```tsx live=false
  // before
  <Box padding="abc" />
  // valid type, but "abc" is not available in the theme

  // after
  <Box padding="abc" /> // invalid
  // Type '"abc"' is not assignable to type '"1" | "2" | ... | undefined'.
  ```

**Icon**

- Added support for styling the `Icon` component from the theme object.

  ```jsx live=false
  const theme = extendTheme({
    components: {
      Icon: {
        width: "auto",
      },
    },
  })
  ```

**Menu**

- Added support for setting the initially focused menu programmatically using
  `initialFocusRef`.

  ```jsx live=false
  const Example = () => {
    const itemRef = useRef(null)
    return (
      <Menu initialFocusRef={itemRef}>
        <MenuButton>Welcome</MenuButton>
        <MenuList>
          <MenuItem>Menu 1</MenuItem>
          <MenuItem ref={itemRef}>Menu 2</MenuItem>
          <MenuItem>Menu 3</MenuItem>
        </MenuList>
      </Menu>
    )
  }
  ```

**React**

- Add `ChakraBaseProvider`, a minimal version of `ChakraProvider` that supplies
  just the theme tokens, and ignores components.

  Historically, one of the biggest causes of the large initial JS payload is the
  size of the component themes. With this approach, you get to apply the theme
  for just the component you need by using `extendBaseTheme`.

  > Base theme refers to the minimal theme for just the design tokens

  ```jsx live=false
  import { ChakraBaseProvider, extendBaseTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"
  import { Button } from "@chakra-ui/theme/components"

  const theme = extendBaseTheme({
    components: {
      Button,
    },
  })

  function App() {
    return (
      <ChakraBaseProvider theme={theme}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ChakraBaseProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

**Styled System**

- Add support for `textIndent` style prop

### Changed

**Theme**

- Fix TS errors and format files

### Added

### Changed

## [2.4.0](./#2.4.0) - 2022-11-14

### Fixed

**All packages**

- Fixed issue where using `@chakra-ui/react` or any sub-package in a TypeScript
  project with `"type": "module"` in `package.json` and
  `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` in `tsconfig.json` cannot find the types.

**Tooltip**

- Fixed issue where dynamically changing a tooltip's `isDisabled` when it is
  open didn't have any effect.

  Now, changing the `isDisabled` prop will close the tooltip leading to a more
  consistent behavior.

### Added

**Card**

- Introduced new `Card` component

```jsx live=false
export function Basic() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <Heading size="md"> Customer dashboard</Heading>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <Text>View a summary of all your customers over the last month.</Text>
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter>
        <Button>View here</Button>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

- Fixed issue where focus sometimes moved back to the open element when it was
  intentionally moved away from it.

**Progress**

- Fixed accessibility issue where the `title` prop was not passed to the
  underlying `role=progress` element.

### Added

**Progress**

- Added support for overriding the `role` for `Progress` eleement. This makes it
  possible to use the progress as a meter element.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Progress size="sm" value={20} role="meter" aria-label="Usage" />
  ```

### Changed

**Checkbox**

- Replaced `framer-motion` with native css animation

**CSS Reset**

- Use `dvh` unit if supported

  This allows the user agent to dynamically adapt the height of a Modal,
  depending on what parts of the UI (e.g. address bar) are visible.

**Theme**

- Replaced `mode` runtime function with CSS variables where possible.

**Visually Hidden**

      Avatar: {
        baseStyle: {
          group: {
            // styles for the AvatarGroup
          },
        },
      },
    },
  })
  ```

### Added

### Changed

## [2.3.3](./#2.3.3) - 2022-09-19

### Fixed

**All components**

- Added missing component/function docs and relative docsite links.

  Ensures that all Components, functions, and hooks that have detailed pages on
  the Chakra site have corresponding TS Docs and links back to the docsite via
  IDE intellisense.

  Includes adding or fixing links within these docs to related WAI-ARIA
  patterns.

**DOM Utilities**

- Update disabled selector to use state selector `:disabled`, instead of
  `[disabled]` attribute selector. This is useful when an editable element is
  wrapped within `<fieldset disabled>` **Menu, Table**
- Remove redundant ARIA roles

**Theme**

- Fixed issue where `--tooltip-fg` css variable was incorrectly applied

**Layout**

- Fixed an issue where `Highlight` showed `key` warnings
- Prevent `Stack` from crashing when there's a lot of child elements

  > NB: This does not help improve loading and refresh performance otherwise,
  > libraries like `react-virtualized` should be used to handle large lists.

**PinInput**

- Fixed issue where backspace did not focus prev input

**Styled System**

- Revert [#6335](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/6335/files) to fix
  issue where lots of responsive styles makes app slower

- Update disabled selector to use state selector `:disabled`, instead of
  `[disabled]` attribute selector. This is useful when an editable element is
  wrapped within `<fieldset disabled>`

- Improve style resolution when components are wrapped within forced color mode
  elements (`DarkMode`, `LightMode`).

  We now dynamically attach the `data-theme` attribute to chakra elements when
  in forced color mode.

  ```jsx live=false
  <DarkMode>
    <chakra.div bg="gray.800" padding="40px">
      {/* Forced: Badge will now have `data-theme='dark' attached` */}
      <Badge>Total</Badge>
    </chakra.div>
  </DarkMode>
  ```

**Tag**

- Use `forwardRef` with `TagCloseButton`

**Theme**

- Fixed css error in `100vh` polyfill

**Menu**

- Fix regression in use menu group state

### Added

### Changed

**Styled System**

- Allow user optin to the `100vh` polyfill because it's only useful in absolute
  or fixed layout modes.

  Chakra now polyfills the `100vh` attribute to use either the literal `100vh`
  or `-webkit-fill-available` where supported. To use this feature, set the
  height values to `$100vh` instead of `100vh`.

  ```jsx live=false
  // Might not work in all cases
  <Box minHeight="100vh" position="absolute">
    Test
  </Box>

  // Polyfilled version ensures 100vh work correctly
  <Box minHeight="$100vh" position="absolute">
    Test
  </Box>
  ```

  <Avatar
    name="Uchiha Itachi"
    src="https://uinames.com/api/photos/female/18.jpg"
  >
    <AvatarBadge placement="top-start" />
  </Avatar>
  ```

**Styled System**

- Added `defineStyle` and `defineStyleConfig` to improve the TypeScript
  authoring experience of style objects and single part component themes.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { defineStyleConfig, defineStyle } from "@chakra-ui/styled-system"

  // authoring style objects
  const style = defineStyle({
    marginTop: "20px",
  })

  // authoring style configs for single part component
  const button = defineStyleConfig({
    baseStyle: {},
    variants: {},
    defaultProps: {},
  })
  ```

- Added `createMultiStyleConfigHelpers` factory that provides functions that
  help improve the TypeScript authoring experience of multipart component
  themes.

  ```jsx live=false
  import { createMultiStyleConfigHelpers } from "@chakra-ui/styled-sytem"

  // create scoped helpers for that defined parts
  const helpers = createMultiStyleConfigHelpers(["button", "label"])
  const { definePartsStyle, defineMultiStyleConfig } = helpers

  // authoring styles for each part
  const outlineVariant = definePartsStyle({
    button: {},
    label: {},
  })

  // authoring styles for multipart component
  const accordion = defineMultiStyleConfig({
    baseStyle: {
      button: {},
      label: {},
    },
    variants: {
      outline: outlineVariant,
    },
  })
  ```

**Styled System**

- Improve style computation performance by looping over styles once. Previously,
  we had two steps in the logic (expand responsive and convert to css object).
  This can be quite expensive with large css objects (or style props).

  We now process both steps in a single pass.

- Fixed regression where `ThemeTypings` created by chakra-cli could not be used
- Escape symbols in css variable to make it work

**Theme**

- Improved contrast of `FormHelperText` to satisfy accessibility check
- Fixed issue where disabled input with flushed or unstyled variant isn't

  It defaults to the parent dir of `<source>`, e.g. `src/theme/theme.ts` =>
  `src/theme`.

  ```shell
  > chakra-cli tokens src/theme/theme.ts --watch

  > chakra-cli tokens --help
  Usage: chakra-cli tokens [options] <source>

  Options:
    --out <path>              output file e.g. node_modules/@chakra-ui/styled-system/dist/declarations/src/theming.types.d.ts
    --strict-component-types  Generate strict types for props variant and size

  ```

**Media Query**

- Add support for client-side rendered (CSR) apps to get the correct value on

  These hooks are built work in server-side rendering (SSR) applications by
  default. You might notice a quick flash of incorrect media query value when
  you use them.

  If you're creating a CSR-only app, you can now leverage the `ssr` argument to
  get the correct value on first render.

  ```jsx live=false
  const [isMobile] = useMediaQuery("(max-width: 768px)", {
    // you can now pass `ssr: false`
    ssr: false,
  })

  const buttonSize = useBreakpointValue(
    { base: "sm", lg: "md" },
    // you can now pass `ssr: false`
    { ssr: false },
  )

  // you can now pass `ssr: false`
  const breakpoint = useBreakpoint({ ssr: false })
  ```

  indicate focus.

  > ðŸš¨ NOTE: This might be a potential breaking change for consumers who use the
  > `extendTheme` with the `_focus` styles. Kindly migrate to `_focusVisible`.

## [2.1.0](./#2.1.0) - 2022-05-22

### Fixed

**All components**

- Ensure types used by other chakra packages are properly exported and imported
  so that `src` directory is not referenced in the emitted type declarations.

**Media Query**

- Fix regression in use-media-query hook in SSR envrionments where it throws
  hydration mismatch

**Textarea**

- Fix ESLint warnings and errors

**Theme**

- Tag component variants borderRadius was overwriting baseStyle eventhough
  borderRadius was same for all variants. borderRadius is now part of the
  baseStyle

**Toast**

- Fix regression with the default toast position. It now defaults to `bottom` as
  described in docs

### Added

**Avatar, Image**

- Add `referrerPolicy` prop

**Styled System**

- Add support for responsive variants and sizes

  ```jsx live=false
  <Button variant={["sm", "lg"]}>Click me</Button>
  ```

- Add support for `!important` in token values as an escape hatch for overriding
  properties in responsive variants/sizes.

  ```jsx live=false
  <Button variant={["sm", "lg"]} fontSize="lg !important">
    Click me
  </Button>
  ```

  **Notes**

  - Based on how this is designed, there's no support for responsive
    `colorScheme` since it is technically not a variant
  - When using responsive sizes and variants, overriding properties via props
    might not work as expected. We use native CSS media queries to enable this
    feature so there's no "magic" under the hood. If you really want to override
    properties, you can consider using the important syntax

### Changed

**Focus Lock**

- Upgrade dependency `react-focus-lock` to be compatible with React 18

## [2.0.2](./#2.0.2) - 2022-05-17

### Fixed

**Color Mode**

- Fix return value of color mode script

### Added

### Changed

## [2.0.1](./#2.0.1) - 2022-05-17

### Fixed

**Checkbox**

- Fix issue where checkbox doesn't reset the the form reset event is triggered

**Color Mode**

- Improve SSR for color mode by adding `manager.get()` in the default state
- Add support `disableTransitionOnChange` option in `ColorModeProvider` and
  `theme.config` to control whether the transition of all elements should be
  temporarily disabled while the color mode changes.
- Expose `cookieStorageManagerSSR` for users who prefer to manage color mode
  server-side. If you use this, there's no need for the `ColorModeScript`

  ```jsx live=false
  function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
    // get the `cookie` from each page `getServerSideProps` return value
    // Note: the implementation is up to you
    const manager = cookieStorageManagerSSR(pageProps.cookie)
    return (
      <ChakraProvider manager={manager}>
        <Component />
      </ChakraProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

- We now provide a way to customize the localStorage / cookie storage key

  ```jsx live=false
  import { createLocalStorageManager } from "@chakra-ui/react"

  const manager = createLocalStorageManager("my-key")

  // in root
  function App() {
    return <ChakraProvider colorModeManager={manager} />
  }

  // in script
  function Document() {
    return <ColorModeScript storageKey="my-key" />
  }
  ```

- Fix inconsistent handling across provider and script

**Theme**

- Refactor global theme to use semantic token to prevent flash of white
- Revert toast's default variant to `solid`
